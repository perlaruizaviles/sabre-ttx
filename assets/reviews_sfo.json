Upon arrival we were informed that out room had been upgraded as it was our anniversary. Upon entering the room, not only did we have a view of the bay and the Golden Gate Bridge, but there was also a complimentary bottle of wine for my wife's birthday. Beautiful room, super-comfy bed! Quiet at night, so great night's sleep! Great breakfast and very helpful concierge. Great location for exploring the city with a cable car terminal right at the side of the hotel on Hyde Street - tip: get there early (about 8-9am) to avoid the queue/line. SaraJ67, We would like to wish you a very happy belated birthday and are so happy to know that you had a wonderful wedding anniversary celebration while staying with us at the Argonaut. Thank you, from all of us, for giving us such high marks - we truly appreciate it when our team receives this type of recognition from our guests! Here's to many happy returns...

BUT THERE ARE SOME PROBLEMS: 1 They take 100 dollars deposit per night. So if you're gonna stay 7 nights you'll need to have 700 dollars just for the hold on your card. 2 They take 25 dollars per night \"RESORT FEE\". Thats a kind of weird thing. When i asked manager about that she told me that for this fee i will get FREE WI FI. But she couldn't explain why it was mentioned that wi-fi is free. You can't refuse to pay that fee and it's not the room rate or tax. It's tricky stupid thing 3 This nice hotel has the dumbest personal in whole SF. We've booked 4 rooms. 3 for one rate and 1 for another. At the time of check in the prices for all 4 rooms were different. ALL 4 PRICES WERE DIFFERENT. We spent an hour trying to figure what was the problem. The manager couldn't even explain why the prices were different. At one night we had fake fire alarm. It was awful. The whole hotel was on the street waiting for fire man to check if everything is ok. At the day of check out they agreed to return to us 200$ for that alarm thing BUT the manager girl PUSHED the WRONG BUTTON & CHARGED EXTRA 200 dollars. Two weeks later we checked our card and discovered that there was NO discount for night fire alarm. Maybe i was unlucky to meet unprofessional manager but it was like that",

      "content": "Spent a wonderful long weekend in San Francisco, staying at the Argonaut Hotel. It's a nice and quiet hotel and for a tourist the location doesn't get any better than this. The free bicycle rental is an excellent bonus. The only complain I have is that we were later on charged $3.5 USD for presumably something out of the minibar. Knowing how expensive those items are, we never consume anything, so this is a bogus charge on behalf of the hotel. Be aware that EXTRA CHARGES MAY APPEAR ON YOUR CREDIT CARD after you have left the country. In our case it would be more expensive to call the hotel to sort this out than the charge is (there is no email for billing issues), but I wanted to advise people to closely check their credit card statements after staying at Argonaut Hotel. :-( Klazu, Thank you for taking the time to share your experience on Tripadvisor. We are delighted you had a wonderful stay with us despite the erroneous honor bar charge. We regret if this incident may have marred what was otherwise been an enjoyable visit to San Francisco. It would be our pleasure to be of service to you again in the future should you be kind enough to give us the opportunity. Take care, Stefan Area Managing Director",

Other than that, it was nice. We paid $67.26 for the valet parking but they were quick when we needed our car for dinner and very helpful with suitcases at check-out.

Great beds. We had a room without a view, basically an internal alley facing other rooms) but who stays in their room in San Francisco? There are countless restaurants and attractions in walking distance. It is right next to the cable car turnstile, making it very convenient to get to Chinatown or just go for a ride. After stays in the business district as well as Union Square, I find this area nice and I surprisingly don't have a sense of tourist overload. I will absolutely stay here again. YALEDOC, We echo your sentiments - our location, while central to most attractions in San Francisco, is also very peaceful and quiet at night. And the Argonaut's vicinity to the waterfront makes this the perfect choice for exploring the sights and sounds of this beautiful city. Thank you for staying with us...and thank you also for considering us for your next trip! When it's time to return, be sure to give us a call or check out our online seasonal specials and packages.

      "content": "Upon arrival I was really excited to stay at the Argonaut. With super friendly staff and a sailor dressed man at the front, it was a very warm welcome. The room was also spacious and had everything I needed. A few minutes into arriving though I noticed a loud gurgling noise coming from the bathroom sink. It was kinda creepy and there wasn't anything I could seem to do to fix it. I intended to notify hotel staff, but assuming this was an old building and with my busy work schedule did not know if it could be fixed and wasn't able to call that day until late at night when I felt uncomfortable with a repairman coming in so I let it be and slept with the bathroom door shut and the air on to drown out the sound. The next day as I was about to turn in, I heard a loud beep coming from one of the alarms/detectors. After a few more beeps I figured out it was the smoke detector and called the front desk. They were quick to resolve the situation by sending a maintenance tech up to my room, however being that it was 10p at night I had to get fully dressed and also felt really uncomfortable letting a stranger into my room when I was staying alone. To make myself feel better about this I stood with the door open in the doorway while he fixed the issue with guests staring at me and into my room as they walked by - talk about throwing all sense of privacy out the door. Since he was there I asked about the loud noise coming from my sink - he said he could fix that easily but it would take about 10-15 minutes. At that point I really just wanted to get to bed and not be standing in the hallway any longer and not have a stranger in my room any longer so I told him it was okay and just figured I'd deal with it. I'm super bummed that these 2 issues came up during my stay because other then that I loved the hotel. I guess the reason it's such a bummer is because they are simple and regular maintenance issues that could have been attended to before I arrived, but instead they kind of ruined my stay. Being a frequent visitor to SF and working with a Large business that also takes a lot of trips to SF I'm super bummed that I won't be able to fully recommend Argonaut to my friends. Hopeful that this review will help future guests have a restful and relaxing stay. Chloe, Thank you for sharing your observations on Tripadvisor. You do us a great service by taking the time out of your busy schedule to write a review. It is through concerned guests, such as yourself, that we gain insight into areas of our business that require attention, areas that may have otherwise gone unnoticed. Please accept our sincerest apologies for the maintenance issues you encountered during your visit. You may rest assured they have been addressed and we sincerely hope that you will allow us another opportunity to demonstrate our true level of hospitality and interest in serving you properly.

From the Bellmen, to the Front Desk staff, everyone was so nice and took great care of us during our stay. We asked for an empty refrigerator so that we could store our own snacks and drinks during our stay. This hotel is literally across the street from Fisherman's Wharf, and across the street from a small beach. There are many restaurants surrounding the area that we enjoyed as well. The cable car stop is just outside the hotel, I highly suggest you take the cable car to Union Square for shopping. This hotel is amazing and I cannot wait to stay here again! Be prepared to pay for parking, and a San Francisco/Resort tax-it's worth it though. I also suggest getting up early in the morning and walking the pier before all the tourists show up. Raggabug76, 5 stars all-around...what a ringing endorsement! Please accept our sincerest thanks for your enthusiastic review and the excellent details you shared on Tripadvisor.

This year was no exception, and we are sorry that we were unable to accommodate your reservation. That said, when it's time to return (hopefully sooner than in another 12 years!), be sure to give us a heads-up so that we can get reservations for guest accommodations and our restaurant all squared away in advance.

Fisherman's Wharf is a bustling place with loads of restaurants and cafes on your doorstep. The hotel itself is really cute. There is a nautical theme throughout done in a non-cheesy way! The room was clean and spacious and we had a great view that included the Golden Gate bridge in the distance! I would highly recommend walking/cycling along the water front to the Golden Gate bridge. We walked there and back as the weather was beautiful. It took us around 5 hours in total, stopping along the way. But the hotel offers a free bike rental service, so that might be a better option! Faye, Yes - free bicycles! And free URB-E scooters, too! First come first serve, of course, so be sure to let us know next time you're planning to visit our beautiful city by the bay and the Argonaut Hotel.

      "content": "We stayed at the hotel for 5 nights in may 2017. Booked the hotel based on TA reviews. Pros - asked for a room on the higher floors and were on the 4th floor (top). The room was internally facing into an empty square ( they need to put some planters or similar in this area) - nice room and great bed. Loved the personalised headboard - had a good restaurant on site in the lobby (think the area is due to renovations currently being done to restaurant area?) Cons- - we weren't too impressed by the casually dressed concierge the day we arrived. Told us to join the reception line for everything even though there was a big Line and he was just standing around. He was a very tall guy who was not impressed or very interested when we spoke to him later about a large pubic hair left on our toilet, which wasn't a pleasant welcome. Room also smelled like animals had pee'd in it. This is a pet friendly hotel, so may have been the case? - very nice staff member showed us to our table at dinner but surprised she had an old cardigan with a large hole in the back of it & no workmates told Her? Was a little taken aback at the clothing as above that some of the staff wore while others were dressed as you would expect. Think they need a uniform as this lets them down Overall a great hotel in a pristine spot in Fishermans wharf. Perfect for tourists and close to the cable car stop, not far from pier 33 etc. Starbucks nearby with great food deliverygirlnz, Thank you for your review and observations. You do us a great service by taking the time out of your busy schedule to write a review. It is through concerned guests, such as yourself, that we gain insight into areas of our business that require attention, areas that may have otherwise gone unnoticed. There is no excuse for the issues you experienced with some of our crew. Although we failed to demonstrate differently, your experience does not, in any way, represent the level of performance of which we are capable and that we provide on a daily basis to our guests. We are only sorry that we failed you in this instance. On a brighter note, you will be happy to know that our Blue Mermaid renovation has been completed and we are now offering our delightful Wharf fare in the restaurant and on the patio again. So, on your next visit, we'd love to introduce you to our food & beverage team led by Executive Chef Nate Mitzner! Warm regards, Stefan Area Managing Director",

Bring or purchase NPS park passes to get onboard the refurbished ships. If you are a senior citizen, you can purchase Lifetime Senior passes and use them at this park. Ghirardelli's Chocolate has two locations nearby so if one is busy, just try the other location up the steps. Walk to the park right across the street and enjoy the beach and the bay. Relax by the fireplace in the Argonaut's lobby and enjoy the nautical decor. Very lovely!

Hyde Street Cable car is right around the corner from the main entrance. For me, the location was the key. When we arrived at the Hotel, the doorman, Donovan was all smiles and positive energy. This attitude was displayed by all the staff. Carlos the bellman, was super helpful with our bags and welcoming us. These folks made me(us) feel very welcome. We upgraded to a suite at check-in and, for our 2 day stay, worked very well. Our room was 201 and was considered ground floor. The view was of a courtyard. We enjoyed the extra space with 5 other family members coming for snacks and drinks later in the day. The concierge was most helpful on recommending a seafood restaurant and in directions on taking the bus to city hall. Our bed was comfortable, the bathroom and shower were very clean big enough for 2 of us. There was a table and big couch in the seating area. As we were only there for 2 nights, we did not eat at the hotel or use any other facilities. I will definitely return to this hotel, the next time I come to SFO. Bob, Though a two day stay is not nearly enough time to experience everything in and around San Francisco, we are delighted you enjoyed your short visit.

We probably could have managed with 1 room for the 4 of us as the rooms are quite big but having a teenage boy and girl it makes it a bit difficult to share. The location is excellent, right in the heart of Fishermans warf and within walking distance of lots of attractions. We hired bikes to ride over the bridge from blazing saddles which is right next door. All the staff were lovely and helpful. My only negative would be the cost of the items in the minibar and leaving all the chocolate on view might be a bit difficult if you have young children. I would recommend this hotel and would definately stay here again. 240vic, Many thanks for your great review and taking the time to specifically point out the excellent service you received from our crew. What a wonderful gesture! We appreciate your recommendation to the Tripasvisor readership and hope to see you again in the not-so-distant future. Travel safe, Stefan Area Managing Director",

The room had a fridge, full the the top with chocalate and water...Which you pay for...Sit down for this bit. Kitcat over $4, water... $6. Stright away this put me off the hotel. The water from a shop ..a costly shop would be around $1. I understand folk need to make money but this is not a budget hotel, meaning they are all ready making a living and does not need the pricing within the rooms.I believe the pricing in the hotel was over the top. The hotel, quite old and really not worth the cost. When staff are agreeing about the water pricing being over the top, it says it all. Avoid this one unless your happy to over pay. macwheeldon, We appreciate your candid review. Our guest rooms all feature fully stocked honor bars, but we do replace them with mini refrigerators upon request. Of course, accommodations at the Argonaut all come with complimentary premium in-room coffee (and tea upon request), while a host of amenities - including infused water in our lobby, complimentary Wi-Fi throughout the hotel, access to our fitness facility, a well-equipped business center with complimentary boarding pass printing, free use of our bicycles and electric scooters, morning newspapers, and discounts at neighboring stores - are all available to our guests throughout their stays. We do hope you took advantage of everything that we offer and hope you will give us another opportunity to be your home away from home when your travels bring you back to San Francisco!

The decor is based on a nautical theme which works well. It's not cheap though but San Francisco tends to be quite pricey in general so it's probably comparable with the area. It's right next to a park area also which was pleasant. The staff were all exceptionally helpful and friendly especially the concierge. The room was clean and spacious and the maids came in everyday. We didn't eat in the restaurant but we ordered sandwiches one evening which were delicious so I'm sure their food in general is of the same standard. Check out must have taken all of 20 seconds.

My wife wanted to cancel our mini family get-away, because she was unaware of where we were going. We kept it as a secret for a surprise mother's day trip for her. We were able to get another flight, but not until after midnight. When we arrived, we were very frazzled, tired and mentally/emotionally exhausted.The front desk staff was expecting us and mentioned they were glad we made it. I have had many emails and communications with Lavon, front desk supervisor, setting up the room with my wife's mothers day gifts. When we entered the room despite being angry and exhausted, my wife was moved to tears of joy. After a long stressful day, we were able to get a very well, deserved peaceful night sleep We were finally able to rest and rejuvenate thanks to the comfort of the room . . The next evening, we left for the airport and our driver got into a wreck causing us to be late for our return flight. We literally had the gate team hold the door for us to board the plane as we ran to the gate. The Argonaut Hotel, Lavon and the staff, saved our mother's day / family vacation. They were truly the EYE in OUR storm....We cant wait to return. Thank you Argonaut staff.

We had a view of the Golden Gate Bridge as well as Ghirardelli Square. The room was spacious and, considering the popularity of the surrounding area, quiet. I did hear some road noise here and there but had restful sleep. One thing that was nice was that any noise from the room's bathroom was well insulated from the rest of the room so if someone in your room uses the bathroom in the middle of the night, it won't wake you up unless you are the lightest of light sleepers. We got room service one night and the food was hot and fresh. Every employee of the hotel with whom we interacted was professional and friendly. We could easily walk to all the places we planned to visit while there with the exception of the Walt Disney Family Museum. Also, since we booked directly with the hotel, we were able to get a $75 room credit which served us well. The hotel is definitely on the pricey side but well worth it, in my opinion. Kimberly, What a wonderful review - thank you so much for sharing your insights on Tripadvisor! Our spacious and airy guestrooms with waterfront views, the historic ships along Hyde Street Pier and vistas of famed Fisherman's Wharf are truly unique, and we're thrilled that you will be back.

      "content": "Stayed at the Argonaut for 4 nights with my mum, and we loved our stay. I'd spent a lot of time in San Francisco previously, but never in Fisherman's Wharf. The rooms are well appointed, the beds are comfortable and the two of us slept really well while staying there. We had two queen sized beds in the room, and it felt like a good size to accommodate that. Some hotel rooms in SF are tiny. Our room's window faced internally, but the room was still bright and we found it to be nice and quiet. No breakfast included. The Wharf is great to walk around during the day, see Pier 39, Alcatraz, get a cable car or a tram. There are some shops, seemed to be mostly touristy type shops. There are very little locals in the area it seemed (which I kind of missed). North Beach isn't far, which is great for Italian food and getting away from the tourist traps. Boudin is always a great option for an inexpensive lunch that's actually incredibly tasty. But after staying in the Wharf area, I think I'll go back over to stay on the other side of the city next time. The Wharf was enjoyable, but the crowds were crazy busy on the weekend and it was actually just hard to get around to see the rest of the city. Union Square area is much more central and you can more easily make use of the BART to get around the Bay Area too. If you're set on staying at Fisherman's Wharf then this is a great option that's reasonably priced compared to some (assuming no conventions are on and you book in advance...!). love_weekenders, We're thrilled you enjoyed your visit at the Argonaut! Housed in the historic Haslett Warehouse, a completely renovated all-brick building over a century old, The Argonaut is the ideal venue to experience the color and ambiance of Fisherman's Wharf. You're also walking distance from other popular nearby attractions including the shops and restaurants of Pier-39, Ghirardelli Square, the tall ships of Hyde Street Pier and the famous Powell-Hyde Street cable car turn-around. One of the major advantage of this location is the easy access to the many sights of the city...and the fact that it's typically very quiet at night, ensuring our guests some rest & relaxation.

      "content": "Stayed here for one night whilst in transit arriving late evening and departing early morning and so this review may not be a fair reflection on this hotel. It‚Äôs a nice hotel with well-appointed rooms but I am unsure about the location. Fisherman‚Äôs Wharf can be a little bit scruffy looking during the day and a single person may feel uncomfortable going out by themselves at night. My overall impression is that it is a good hotel but in the wrong location and as previously mentioned we were in transit and only stayed for one night. Frequentravellers16, Thank you for your review! Fabled Fisherman's Wharf is one mile long but stretches back decades into the most colorful years of San Francisco's history. The iconic site not only was a witness to the days of tall ships, Barbary Coast roustabouts and Gold Rush fever, it was the central player. Today, it's still the number one attraction for most visitors to the City by the Bay. Families in particular love attractions here such as the Ripley's Believe it or Not, the Hyde Street Pier with its historic clipper ships, and Hornblower boat tours of the Bay to see sights such as famous Alcatraz Island. But Fisherman's Wharf is much more than a piece of history. The area is a vibrant piece of San Francisco's fabric of daily life for locals. From the older Italian-American gents playing bocce ball in Aquatic Park to fit joggers running the nearby footpaths, Fisherman's Wharf still moves to the rhythm of the city and the Argonaut is happy to call it home. Housed in the historic Haslett Warehouse, a completely renovated all-brick building over a century old, The Argonaut is the ideal venue to experience the color and ambiance of Fisherman's Wharf. You're also walking distance from other popular nearby attractions including the shops and restaurants of Pier-39, Ghirardelli Square, the tall ships of Hyde Street Pier and the famous Powell-Hyde Street cable car turn-around. Many who visit us call these attractions the highlight of their stay. We're just lucky enough to call it our front yard! We hope you'll be able to spend a few more days with us on your next visit and experience everything there's to see and do in our neck of the woods... Cheers! Stefan Area Managing Director",

      "content": "I have visited Fishermans Wharf before, around 7 years ago. This time I returned with my wife and decided to stay in the same area again. The hotel is very good, the bedroom large and the bed/pillows very comfy. The bathroom is probably not what you would expect from a room that is around $400 per night. The coffee machine was terrible, it leaked when you poured it and although you are given two pouches of coffee per day (enough for at least four cups) you were only given two milk powders. The room had a safe, iron and board. As with most good hotels , the snacks and drinks from the minibar were a silly price, why do they do this? Back to the area, I don't believe it is the best area to stay anymore. Everything is overpriced in the Wharf, the restaurants are not the best either, at night the area was more like a ghost town. That said transport from here includes the tram line and cable cars (big queues for the latter), so getting around is easy. The tram is $2.50 per journey, so this could get you down to the baseball stadium, great value for a long journey. Bike hire available all round and so easy to get to the Golden Gate Bridge, the hotel has limited complimentary vouchers for the bikes. The standard city open top red buses are just down the road (couple of blocks) as well, cost not far short of $50 per 24hr pass. Back to the hotel, there is little I can really fault, the staff were first class and a special mention to the concierge Paula, who was happy to arrange things in advance of our visit. The bar area and restaurant were small, but adequate. I did request an English tea one morning and got a \"no\"......disappointing Conclusion, nice hotel, great staff...I've stayed in many places in the world, for the price, you should be able to get a cup of tea! Mark, Thank you from all of us for recognizing the efforts of our staff (despite encountering an apparent shortage of English Tea to complement our current Himalayan Darjeeling selection) and giving a special shout-out to Paula at the Concierge Desk. We truly appreciate the gesture! You are right - Fisherman's Wharf is ever-changing, with most of the late-night activities shifting to Pier 39. The good news: it's just a casual 5 minute stroll from the Argonaut while our location across from historic Hyde Street Pier, Victoria Park, and Ghirardelli Square is typically blissfully quiet at night...serving our guests the best of both worlds!

We hiked to the Golden Gate Bridge - fantastic views - a 1 hour hike to get there and another hour back. Weather is typically windy since you're right on the Bay. Hotel lets you reserve bikes for free. annie, Many thanks for sharing your comments on Tripadvisor and taking the time to specifically pointing our our crew's dedication to excellence. The Argonaut's waterfront location is indeed second to none, and coupled with the many amenities we offer to our guests, it's really one of the best overall values around. We're looking forward to seeing you again on your next trip to the City by the Bay! Be well, Stefan Area Managing Director",

They charged us for parking and we didn't even have a car! Of course they took it off when it was brought to their attention. Amy, We're thrilled that you and your niece had a very enjoyable birthday celebration at the Argonaut. On behalf of our valet parking service, please accept our apologies for the misposting.

As well, we were wrangling 2 dogs who wanted out of the car. The doorman made us feel at ease right away and said many people pull up with Trader Joe luggage (shopping bags). We were directed right away to a green space to water the dogs, and when we returned, our luggage and dogs' luggage had been whisked up to our room. The concierge helped us find a mobile groomer as one of our Girls badly needed a bath and a haircut. The room was bigger than I expected, with two very comfortable beds. The toiletries are top quality. We had a nice view of the Bay and Alcatraz. My only criticism is the window could have done with cleaning outside. We were given an excellent seniors' rate and the dog fee was waived for booking with the hotel, which made the hotel more affordable than expected. Parking prices are a killer, but not much can be done about that...it is San Francisco. I enjoyed the hotel and would go back. All the employees were charming and pleasant.

Every evening, all the guests got together in the lounge, sat around the fire, and drunk complimentary wine, and talked about their day.It was perfect. Move forward 6 years - the price was now $600 per night for a run of the house room. ( we are at the back of the hotel overlooking a street that gets noisy early am. The lounge downstairs is now empty, the wine reception long gone. It's just another hotel. The staff - from check in, to the cleaning ladies and wait staff in the restaurant - they have all been wonderful. We dined in the Blue Mermaid one evening, their chowders are fabulous. Unfortunately we have been unable to get a table at breakfast, as the dining area is very small. We had to walk a long way to find somewhere for breakfast. Fishermans wharf is quiet these days, and there were not a lot of options. We won't be back. Our room - spacious and comfortable. But not worth what we paid. San Francisco has added lots of new taxes. $22 per night \"urban city tax\". 5% tax as a cost of doing business....it's wrong. Great way to lose tourists. Travebug, Thank you for sharing your comments on Tripadvisor. We are happy to know that you found our team members all to be delightful and you enjoyed one of our award-winning chowders at The Blue Mermaid. Those chowders are indeed most excellent!

It is terrific to read that our Argonaut crew was friendly, helpful, and professional! The Argonaut is definitely a unique hotel, located in the historic Haslett Warehouse, a grand building built in 1907 of exposed brick, Douglas Fir beams and so much seaside character. And other Noble House properties are similarly intriguing, each one meticulously designed to stand on its own merits. That said, the unifying thread that connects each and every hotel is not the architecture or the amenities, but lies within the people - and the local culture - that make up Noble House Hotels & Resorts.

Jorge at the front was very helpful in giving us directions to shopping as we had left our son's bag back in Boston and needed an entire wardrobe! Other doormen were also very helpful in arranging a car service to bring us out to Muir Woods. The driver waited for us during our hike and also gave us an impromptu tour of the city.

I checked out of the Palace early and went to a conference. Afterwards, I got back to the hotel and went to the bellmen to retrieve my bag. I had two urgent things I needed to do online. I asked a bellman for the lobby password, and he said he'd be right back with it. I next saw him walking straight to the front door to help arriving guests with their bags. Huh? Why did he tell me he'd be right back if he had no intention to do so? Another bellman came around and I asked the same thing, he quickly looked at a card taped to his desk, and gave me the password and went back to do his work. Cool. Except the password didn't work. A third bellman came by and I explained to him what happened. He gave me the same password that didn't work and I told him it as much. He looked at me blankly, and said \"I'm sorry I can't help you.\" If there are four words that a self-proclaimed luxury hotel should never say, it's \"I can't help you.\" He didn't even try suggesting I talk to the front desk or concierge.

      "content": "I stayed at the Palace hotel for two nights in June of 2017. The hotel interior is beautiful, all of the staff were very friendly, and the room itself was very nice. It is a historic hotel so the rooms (especially the bathrooms) may not be as large as more modern hotels, but mine (a deluxe King room) was just fine for me. There was a refrigerator in the room, though no coffee maker (unless I missed it), but I presume they‚Äôd bring one if requested. I had a drink at the Pied Piper bar which is very nice, but otherwise did not eat at the hotel. There are plenty of restaurants and such within walking distance. The concierge was extremely helpful both in recommending a hotel on the first night and in providing maps and advice on sightseeing at Golden Gate Park and Pier 39. The only issue I had was with the airport shuttle in the morning. I asked the bell desk where the shuttle would pick me up and they instructed me to stand outside in front of the lobby, which I did, only to find that the driver had been waiting inside the lobby for a while, and then was snippy with me even though he apparently saw me standing there with my luggage and didn‚Äôt approach me to ask if I was waiting for the shuttle (said something to the effect of, ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know who you are! Only you know who you are!‚Äù urr.. okay). The shuttle itself was an old van with no shocks. Also wasn‚Äôt told that the shuttle wasn‚Äôt complimentary‚Ä¶ didn‚Äôt know it cost $16 until we got to the airport. Luckily I had cash on me. Overall, I was happy with my stay. The Palace is a historic hotel (the site of President Warren Harding‚Äôs death, amongst other things) and has a beautiful interior. The location is good. The rooms are beautiful and comfortable. The staff is friendly and helpful. The hitch with the shuttle notwithstanding, I‚Äôd have no issues staying here again.",

My room was fairly large and very quiet. The one negative was the view of the courtyard was more like a view of a back alley. The dining experience was average. Breakfast was geared toward getting guests to choose the buffet with over priced a la carte items. The buffet did have a great selection but I generally don't need that much food, especially when traveling for work. The service was also quite slow--the first morning I didn't get a coffee refill and had to ask repeatedly for the check. The fire alarm went off when I was showering at 5am the last morning. It appeared to be over sensitive to the steam and was just in my room, but not a pleasant experience. The gym and pool area were great! Overall, a well appointed hotel and comfortable accomodations.",

      "content": "A glitch in the online booking system for my credit card points landed us at the reception desk on a Sunday morning without a reservation. We were already late for the Giants game and started to panic as we realized we did not have a hotel room. The hotel was full, but the clerk was first rate: she talked to her manager and they found us a room, gave us a fair rate, checked us in and we were on our way to the game within 30 minutes. This hotel is beautiful - marble appointments, gleaming fixtures and furnishings. The room was spotless, comfortable, quiet (inside corridor). Location is convenient to ATT Park, Union Square, Embarcadero. Every time we saw a hotel employee we were asked if we needed anything, the service is very friendly. We had dinner at the Pied Piper bar, food and ambiance were good, very expensive. Breakfast at the Garden Court was also pricey, but so enjoyable in this stunningly beautiful room. Overall an excellent stay, we will return to this hotel. All that said, San Francisco is no longer a preferred destination for us. We go to a few Giants games every year, and have celebrated Christmas here for years, but the conditions in this city have deteriorated to the point that we hesitate to visit anymore. The streets are filthy. In the less than a mile walk from the ballpark to the hotel, we encountered scores of homeless people, some in such pathetic condition - a man half naked in the street with his head on the curb, looking nearly dead, people digging in garbage cans, curled up in doorways. There were tents erected on the sidewalks, garbage piled everywhere, human waste on the sidewalk and in the gutters, a putrid smell, block after block. It was truly shocking. What has happened to San Francisco?? It is a disgrace that such a famous and wealthy city is in this condition. Shame on the officials for not dealing with the homeless situation and the poor souls that haunt the streets of this once beautiful city. I am so glad we were able to find a room for you in enough time before the game! Speedy, yet quality service is our goal and the team does such a great job accommodating the needs of our guests. I will be sure to pass along your compliments accordingly and thank you for sharing! Sincerely, Jamie E",

      "content": "The Palace Hotel is in a gorgeous, historic San Francisco building. However, with its renovated rooms and clean, modern indoor swimming pool, there is nothing old and fuddy-duddy about it. We stayed in a king room on the 4th floor, facing the interior courtyard (no view, but we didn't pay for one). Nevertheless, the ceilings were very high which made the room feel spacious, making up for the lack of view. The room was renovated and clean, the bed was comfortable with soft pillows. We felt right at home. The hotel is right by the Montgomery Street BART station but it was always easy enough to catch a Lyft. There is also a Ghiradelli attached to the hotel and a Starbucks around the corner. San Francisco will always have some homeless folks around, but I never felt uncomfortable walking around the Palace itself. Speaking of food, we splurged on breakfast in the Garden Court restaurant... $6 coffee and a $22 waffle... but oh my, what a waffle it was! It was crunchy yet light with ricotta and crystallized basil. I loved the early 1900s grand architecture of the Garden Court. I had also previously eaten at the hotel's other restaurant, the Pied Piper - that restaurant's decor is more old-fashionedly handsome and they've got good drinks and burgers. Next time you stay in the city and are looking for something historical yet modern, I highly recommend the Palace!",

The absolutely gorgeous display of flowers in the main lobby looked like botanical garden display. Lush and lively, the colors added to classic d√©cor of the lobby. Check-in: The Platinum/Gold SPG line was short, there was only 1 person in front of us. We were promptly checked in within minutes. Lobby/Common Areas ‚Äì with so many new hotels that have gone under renovation, I love that even after the major upgrades last year, the Palace has kept it‚Äôs timeless beauty. The Garden Court and GC Lounge Bar have been refreshed with hues of greys and cream. The gorgeous crystal chandeliers and magnificent glass ceilings have all been maintained meticulously. Room: I am an SPG Platinum member and had used a Suite Night upgrade and was upgraded to a Superior Suite. But, since we were starting our Anniversary tour with SPG (we spend 2 to 5 weeks every summer with SPG to celebrate our Anniversaries and birthdays) and we were also hosting another couple, I had requested something special for our special day. Casey, Assistant Director of the Front Desk, delightfully upgraded to one of the newly renovated Palace Suites. We loved every inch of the suite. Our room was a corner suite that overlooked Market Street. Each window had a small seating ledge where we could sit and watch the world go by. Market was lined with Pride flags, which was such a nice sight to see. The living room was furnished with modern and chic d√©cor. We loved the chandelier and art that graced the walls. Our bedroom had a large King poster bed and a chaise lounge in front. The bathroom had double sinks, a deep bathtub and a separate stand up shower. The bathroom amenities were plentiful and when we needed more toiletries, housekeeping was quick to bring them up. I love all the Gilchrest and Soames toiletries ‚Äì all very luxurious. Our friends stayed in the fold out sofa bed. For a sofa bed, it was quite comfortable. Service ‚Äì I cannot give enough kudos to the Palace Staff. The front desk staff were kind and assisted when they could. I would like to highlight one particular staff member who has continually made our stays so special ‚Äì Casey ‚Äì Assistant Director. Casey has helped us in the past and never ceases to amaze me with his level of professionalism and how he goes out of his way to ensure our stays are the best they can be. He secured our upgrade and lovely welcome Anniversary greeting. When we realized we had left our wine carrier with a very special 2006 Justin Isosceles in our room, I reached out to Casey. It was found and will find it‚Äôs way back to us. From start to finish, Casey and the Palace staff could not have been more helpful. We had a little glitch with our breakfast reservation and the use of our Platinum Amenity (breakfast in the Garden Court hotel), but it ended up working out fine. FYI ‚Äì breakfast ends at 10:30am on Saturdays and Sundays, a little early for us, but lovely if you are an early bird. Pied Piper ‚Äì We love the new and improved bar. It kept it‚Äôs classic look, but is nice and shiny now. The bartenders made excellent craft cocktails. I highly recommend a Manhattan and a French 76 (75 with vodka). Thank you again for yet another fabulous Palace stay.",

Only downsides for me was the very expensive parking in their own parking garage ( although I am aware that this is a city issue more than a hotel issue) and the scandalous cost of using WiFi in the hotel.

It did drop a bit, for a couple of days, but I'd prepaid so I was locked in. The price was still the best of our group. I had been a rewards member prior to booking and used my membership number. This got me free wifi ($15/day) for the duration using the pre-pay deal. I put in my booking that I'd like an early arrival, which was not a problem. We ended up getting a top floor room with nice, tall ceilings. There was an option to upgrade to a suite, be it didn't seem necessary for this short stay. Everyone we encountered was great, and we did food and cocktails several times in the Pied Piper. Room service was very good, and seemed to offer options you didn't have in the dining room (other than maybe the buffet, which was more than we'd eat). It's right in front of the Montgomery BART station too. We took the BART in, which was $8.95/pp. At the time of the day we arrived, this was quicker than traffic. For the ride to the airport, we opted for Uber since it was only about $10 more and there was no real traffic for our ride. I could see us staying here again.",

The lobby and area in the middle i.e. where guests can enjoy breakfast/afternoon tea/dinner is very plush ‚Ä¢ Malia is a great help at concierge, she was very friendly (won‚Äôt mention the other lady‚Äôs name in concierge who worked in the evenings, who was NOT helpful at all) ‚Ä¢ Arthura at check in was very friendly and welcoming ‚Ä¢ The bell boys and guys at the entrance of the hotel were also helpful and friendly Con‚Äôs: ‚Ä¢ We had the DELUXE room with 2 double beds for the 3 of us ‚Äì however, these ‚Äúdouble‚Äù beds were more like a slightly bigger single bed! This hotel was very expensive for what it was and we refused to pay extra for a bigger room ‚Äì the beds were very disappointing. I have been to 5* hotels with double beds and these were not doubles! ‚Ä¢ The plumbing ‚Äì we could hear our neighbours every time they flushed their toilet or used the shower! During each night, we could hear strange sounds coming from our bathroom plumbing! Very annoying. ‚Ä¢ No shower cubicle‚Ä¶just a tub with a waterfall shower (with rubbish water pressure) ‚Ä¢ No mirrors in the room except in the bathroom ‚Äì not ideal when 3 women are trying to get ready at the same time ‚Ä¢ We ordered a kettle, cups and creamers to keep in our room as they were not provided initially (we had our own teabags ‚Äì we are British and love our tea!). We‚Äôd usually have a cup of tea in our room in the mornings but would come back in the evening only to see that everything else had been cleared in our room except the cups! We didn‚Äôt understand why this was ‚Ä¢ We noticed people would order room service and leave their used plates/trays outside in the hallway but this would lie there for hours before someone picked it up (I noticed other reviews saying the same) ‚Ä¢ Room service prices were extortionate (i.e. $20 for a small margherita pizza!) ‚Ä¢ Breakfast prices were extortionate (for the 3 of us the bill for one breakfast would be about $100!) ‚Ä¢ Walls are very thin‚Ä¶we could hear whenever other guests slammed their doors shut ‚Ä¢ On our first morning there, our door knocked whilst we were still asleep (it was about 9am) and it was the cleaner‚Ä¶she called out to let us know it was the cleaner but before we could get up to open the door, she‚Äôd opened our door and had walked in! We would not have minded if she‚Äôd waited at least 30 seconds before walking in! I thought this was a little inconsiderate, so after this incident we started leaving our privacy tag on our door ‚Ä¢ Wifi for us was complimentary which means normally you would have to pay for it! Overall impression: For the money we spent on this ‚Äú5*‚Äù hotel, I didn‚Äôt think the service/room quality was 5*. I can only comment for the DELUXE room: The room and beds were smaller than rooms you would get with 2 double beds. The bathroom was disappointing; no shower cubicle ‚Äì very dated. The strange noises from the plumbing/corridors were irritating. No kettle/cups in the room. Expensive room service/breakfast. Not sure if I would upgrade to a bigger room when you‚Äôre paying so much already! (I have spent the same amount in Dubai/Europe/New York and have got a nicer room and service!) would only stay here again if there‚Äôs no other choice in SF. Thank you so much for sharing such a detailed visit with us. I sincerely appreciate your feedback and will relay everything mentioned to each department head. I apologize for the inconveniences you experienced throughout your stay and I will assist each department in finding solutions moving forward. Wishing you happy traveling, Jamie E.",

      "user": "The_Loup_Garou",
      "content": "We stayed at the Palace Hotel on April 30 - May 02, in room 598. We have stayed at the Palace Hotel now, 26 times, and 4 times in one week last year ‚Äì though those were for single night stays, where my wife had to fly back and froth between Phoenix and San Francisco. This was a more typical 2-3 night stay for us.. Our room was facing the roof of the pool, the Garden Court, and the interior area of the hotel. My wife likes these rooms, as they are quieter. Even on the outside rooms, the Palace is surrounded by taller buildings, so there are no ‚Äúviews.‚Äù While I have not found any room to be noisy, my wife complained about one of the corner suites (a very nice room), overlooking Market St. This was a King bed room Jr Suite, with a small bathroom, with a very small, single sink vanity. The bathroom featured a tub/shower, where my wife tries for one of the similar rooms w/ a walk-in shower. None were available. Some of these rooms have a larger vanity, which is good for placing cosmetics, etc., but some have very minimal space. This was one of those. As the Palace Hotel is an older (one of, if not the oldest, hotels in San Francisco), the rooms are various sizes. Over the years, I think that we have stayed in at least one of each room type. Our room had a dresser, with large, flat-screen TV on top of it. Some do not have a dresser, but only ‚Äúsuitcases‚Äù in the nightstands, as drawers. We had those suitcases on our nightstands, but also the dresser. We had a full closet, with an iron and ironing board. Some of the rooms have no closet, but a wardrobe, instead. Our King bed was comfortable, and the pillows nice. We had charging stations on the nightstands, plus on the desk, though that one was broken, and reported to management. The room was adequately spacious, and was quiet. The greeting by the front desk was much more friendly, on this visit. While the bellmen know us, and the doormen know us (even know the address of my wife‚Äôs corporate office, when hailing a cab each morning), the front desk folk have checked us in every other night, and asked ‚Äúhave you ever stayed with us before?‚Äù That always was a bit off-putting, but maybe they are taking a bit more notice of their returning patrons? The property has two dining venues, the lovely, and stately Garden Court, plus Maxfield‚Äôs/Pied Piper. They operate at different times, and have different menus, so one needs to check. In the building, but accessed from New Montgomery St, the Flatiron Wines & Spirits is a wine/liquor shop, a wine tasting room, and also offers the menus from the Pied Piper, at lunch ‚Äì which can be charged to your room in the Palace. We printed our boarding passes in the Concierge area, and had the opportunity to update Concierge, Debbie Liu of our dining in San Francisco, so that she could assist other guests with recommendations. Note: if there is a line at the computer + printer, the Concierge will print boarding passes. We are returning to the Palace in early June, and looking forward to our stay.",

      "content": "this is a classic lovely old hotel, but when you arrive the music is blaring outside on the street from the moment you step out of your car. Once you enter the lobby it is worse, because the volume of the music is so loud you can barely hear the guests traveling with you. Where as most hotels have a peaceful relaxing lobby, and it feels like your extended living room. The music levels there make you want to go back up to your own hotel room and escape the place. This is too bad because the skylight is stunning in the interior room and the staff is lovely. The breakfasts are beautiful in the big skylight room (although a bit pricey) but someone needs to coach them on their music (playlists and volume levels). Hello and thank you so much for the input! I apologize the music level disturbed you and I will make sure it is set an even tone. I appreciate you taking the time to share this with me and we look forward to welcoming you back.

Maxfield Parrish painted himself as the Piper. The Garden Court is a wonderful light-filled open space off the main hallway. The vintage glass ceiling floods the room with light. Lovely chandeliers and sconces add additional sparkle to this room. Afternoon tea was being served when we stopped in for wine and a cheese plate. A harpist was playing at the front of the room.

My room was ready upon check in and as I made my way to my room, I noticed just how clean everything was and the classic style in which the hotel was renovated. My room was good size and very comfortable. It had plenty of power outlets, light, and the HVAC worked well which can certainly be a pet peeve. The bathroom was very nice and the toiletries were high-end. I ordered room service, and while predictably pricey, the meal came quickly and was very good. You cannot beat the location of this hotel.

The Palace underwent a renovation in 2015 and now ranks with the best hotels in the City. The rooms are very spacious and well appointed. The hotel is classic and elegant, but with a contemporary \"Crate and Barrel\" type vibe. Our one-bedroom suite was done in grays and whites, with beautiful marble in the bathroom. The bedroom was very large, with a comfortable king-sized bed, and the sitting area included a nice couch, large flat-screened TV, chair, and desk with chairs on each side. The high ceilings added to the spacious feel of the suite. But the most impressive thing about the Palace was the helpful and friendly staff. From checkin to checkout, and especially during our buffet breakfast (which was included in the cost of the room), everyone was incredibly gracious, attentive, and genuinely friendly. We ended up having long conversations with both of our servers at breakfast. I should mention that the Garden Court Lounge and Restaurant off the hotel lobby, is one of the most beautiful rooms in all of San Francisco. If you stay at the Palace, make sure to have afternoon tea in the Lounge. Another plus for the Palace is its location on New Montgomery, just off Market, close to everything. All in all, this is a wonderful option when you stay in the City, because of great quality, service, and location.",

      "content": "Spent 5 nights at The Palace Hotel in May 2017. This hotel is quite old but it was renovated a couple years ago so the rooms are very nice. We had an inner courtyard room which was fairly isolated from the busy noise of the streets. I used my SPG points for this 5 night stay and we had a complimentary upgrade to a deluxe room. We stayed 1 night in a room on the 8th floor, but the mirror in the bathroom was so high that my wife who is 5ft tall couldn't use it properly. We requested to change rooms in morning and the staff were great in finding us a new room on the 6th floor. The new room although slightly smaller, had a larger bathroom with a much better layout. I had seen some reviews indicting a lack of clothes storage and that is true. There is very limited drawers and storage if you want to unpack your clothes. The beds were a little hard for my liking, but they have good feather pillows and both my wife and I slept well on each night of our stay. We traveled to the hotel using the BART line from the SFO airport, and the trip takes about 35 minutes. This cost $20 ($10 each) as that is what the default price comes up on their kiosks, although each ticket indicates $8.95 one-way. Found out later you have to adjust the price on the screen to the listed fare. The BART train has a stop (Montgomery) right in front of the hotel and once you get up to the sidewalk it is literally about 20ft to the door of the hotel which was very convenient. Only issue was the escalator up to the street level was out of service so I had to pack my 50lb suitcase up the stairs which wasn't overly enjoyable. We had breakfast at the Garden Court 2 days of our stay and it was one of the best hotel buffet breakfasts I think we have had. If it wasn't for the price ($38/ea) we would have ate here each morning. The other days we had breakfast at the Corner Bakery Cafe which is just on the outside corner of the hotel with access from the sidewalk. Good prices and food. On 2 evenings we had dinner at the Pied Piper lounge and on both occasions the food was excellent. For getting around the city there is a bus and streetcar stop right out front of the hotel so that is also a very nice time saver for transportation needs. Overall the staff here were great, we got some outstanding restaurant recommendations from the concierge, the hotel housekeeping & restaurant staff were excellent and friendly. So if we ever return to San Francisco this would likely be my first choice to stay again.",

So all in all this is a good 4 star hotel at best which needs a good stick start to bring it to luxury status. I won't be rushing back anytime soon! I really appreciate you taking the time to share your experience with me and I apologize for the issues you encountered throughout your visit. Your comments will be mentioned to our management team and addressed accordingly. Thank you for the feedback and we look forward to welcoming you back, Jamie E.",

      "content": "The Palace Hotel is in a great part of San Francisco. Easy to walk to restaurants, tourist attractions and public transportation. The lobby is outstanding with huge soaring ceilings. You definitely feel as though you are in Europe. This is a great hotel for families with kids. The indoor pool is a life saver and at the end of the day the pool was filled with families. If you're looking for a romantic poolside moment, don't bother. It's loud and echoes in the pool area. It's definitely best for exercise and kids having fun. The gym is fully equipped, air conditioned and looks out on to pool. Now for the rooms: We are used to staying at hotel through American Express Fine Hotels & Resorts. This room was just ok. When we walked in to the room near the tv there was a huge stain on the carpet that looked like a child spilled all their milk. When I went to the bathroom the toilet paper holder was falling out of the wall and the toilet seat was crooked. I called Management and they sent people in to fix it right away which I appreciated. But you shouldn't have to do this upon arrival. I don't get how anyone cleaned that room and thought this was ok. That night they also messed up our room service and the poor guy who delivered our food went back down to get us what was needed. The following night I called to place another room service order (I had 2 small kids with me) and the woman literally could not answer one question I had and there was a definite language barrier. I expect things to go a lot smoother than this for the price I was paying for this stay. Management once again took care of this an apologized. They were nothing but kind. More of an annoyance. Also, our room on 4th floor was noisy. Faced street, you could hear music and doors slamming throughout stay. I've stayed in nicer in San Francisco that's for sure. If you're looking for a big hotel feel, grand entry and easy access to activities, this will be great. If you have kids, it will be a life saver with the pool. If you're looking for true 5 star, go someplace else. Thank you for sharing your experience with me and I apologize for the issues you encountered throughout your stay. I am happy to hear our management team was able to assist you and your family when needed, but I will still relay your comments to the appropriate department leaders. I appreciate the feedback given and truly hope we are able to welcome you and your family again soon. Sincerely, Jamie E.",

      "content": "The Palace Hotel is San Francisco incarnate: Opulent, impressive, proudly architectural. Unfortunately, it continues its tasteless decline under current management decisions. First came the abortive effort attempt to sell the iconic Maxfield Parrish painting. Next the incredible Garden Court, one of the most impressive interior spaces in America, was fenced in half like a tennis court and suffered a \"redecoration\" with mail order (looking) furniture. And now the elegant Palace dining room has succumbed. This incredible room, with rich paneling, leaded glass ceiling, and a mosaic floor like an oriental rug, was once my favorite dining experience in San Francisco. Now, most of the dining furniture has been removed and replaced with bar pods. Two of the magnificently paneled walls have been hidden under pointless mirrors, upon which hang two glaringly huge televisions. The mirrors apparently enable the televisions to entertain each other, for I observed that no human being was taking any notice of them. But the height of tasteless incongruity is a fake video fireplace that has been tacked onto the wine vault. In short, the Palace Hotel management has converted a once magnificent room into a sports bar. Perhaps they see a niche to fill now that the Hooters on Fisherman's Wharf is closed. Once the highlight of my visits, I have eaten my last meal in the Palace. In closing, I don't expect the Palace Hotel management to rid itself of any of these self-inflicted wounds soon, but I beg, I plead, if nothing else, remove the fence that destroys the original proportions of the incredibly beautiful Garden Court. It can always be donated to the San Francisco police as a street barrier for any future parades.",

We were in town only for the night as we were attending and event at the Moscone Center which is within walking distance..... from the time we valet our car with in and out service with the Valet being so nice.... to the front desk service with smiles and prompt service..... The room itself was amazing from the ambiance, cleanliness, with everything you may need.... to the sewing kits (which by the way I needed), while I got ready my friend went to the Pied Piper Bar for the Dirty Martinis (he said they were the best he ever had) and Oysters...... We went to our concert, came back they provided turn down service with water next to the bed and chocolates on the pillows, slippers laid out and an extra blanket......We awoke early to have breakfast.... Amazing.... that is all I can say about that..... the breakfast area, the food, the service......My friend went to relax while I went to enjoy the gym, the pool and the hot tub..... More amazing, clean, towels, music the whole experience..... and while we moved throughout the hotel there was not one employee that was not professional, pleasant, and friendly...... I was sad to checkout as there was no disappointments the staff was prompt to get our luggage, check us out and the car was pulled up front quickly....we only had a few minutes to speak with the doorman where we got two of the best kept secrets on Pacific 1 Highway......Thank You to all the staff that made our experience a memory that will stay with us forever....",

Didn't have time to even see it, but my crew said it was terrific. My room was extremely clean, comfy bed, enough space for two people, and modern. Wifi all over works very well. Grand Ballroom fit 800 theater style with our LED wall, don't know what it would be with projection. We fit 51 rounds of 10 with space for theater in the back, and production and camera risers. The load in was street level and took us 30 minutes to off load a semi. Steven Twaddell- The best! He is the hotel conference manager and cares so much about every aspect of the event. As an outside production vendor I typically get push back because the in-house AV company isn't getting revenue (of which 50% gets kicked back to the hotel). The Palace didn't give me push back at all, in fact they gave me lots of love. Thank you Steven! Ballrooms are modernized, well kept, friendly staff. There are chandelier, but we worked around them with our LED wall no problem. Site lines worked well from all views. Ghirardelli chocolate/ice cream shop in the lobby, and a Star Bucks across the street.",

Wait to be seated, despite many open tables. Wait for coffee. Then wait for milk to put in coffee. Wait for check when finished. Good quality food on buffet, but eggs, whether scrambled or Benedict, are cold when put out. Not just on one day. A shame, because this could be a fantastic place for breakfast.

Our Deluxe King Room on the 8th floor was more spacious than we were expecting. We had an interior room, so not much of a view but quiet. The bed and comforter felt heavenly. The furniture had a \"Brics\" Luggage look. Classic suitcases designed into furniture. There was a safe, mini fridge empty for us to fill, & large leather armoire with 3 drawers inside. We requested an extra luggage rack the next morning for hubby's suitcase. I think an ottoman at the end of the bed would be a useful touch to the room. The bathroom was not overly large but lots of luxury amenities, including my favorite...a heated toilet seat. Nice robes, soft large towels, fine shampoos, etc. Great lighting as well. Just walking through the hallways was a pleasure. If you love high ceilings, crown molding, and vintage fixtures this is the place for you. This was our first stay at the Palace but 5th trip to San Francisco in 2 years. We ate the buffet breakfast both mornings in the grand Garden Court. Yes, it is about $80 for two people but worth every penny. Breakfast in a luxury hotel in most cities cost this much without the beautiful setting. We also ate dinner at the Pied Piper. Prawn Tempura & Lobster Mac & Cheese exceptional. Later, we also managed to find room for a hot fudge sundae from the Ghirardelli Chocolate Shop in the hotel. Warning you will smell chocolate in the elevators! The location of the Palace is perfect for getting to Union Square and waking down to the Ferry Building. We usually stay in Union Square but really prefer this quieter area. The staff was super nice, everybody really treated us well and thanked us for being Starwood Gold Members.

However, the Manager on duty was kind enough to provide us the travel costs as a credit with the hotel, as well as additional amenities for our extremely long wait at check-in. We used these credits at both The Pied Piper and The Palace Bunch located on site. Both dining experiences exceeded our expectations - that was one of the best brunches we have ever had!

      "title": "Disappointing...",
      "user": "wanderever",
      "content": "I spent 4 nights at the Palace. I booked a Deluxe room with a promotional upgrade to the next category. Before my trip I'd seen a few reviews with photos indicating views straight into a wall/gravelled corner of nothingness(!), so I reached out to Guest Services in advance and was pre-assigned a room with a view, as an apparent 'upgrade'. I was pleased about this because a) it provided me with a guarantee before my trip and a good impression of the hotel's customer service; and b) when I'd made my reservation online I'd already got a promotional 'one category upgrade' for the price paid, so assumed it would be a little nicer than that even - so I was feeling really confident and excited about my upcoming stay. POSITIVES 1). Location - superb!!! Prominent position on Market Street. Right next to a BART station, so travelling from SFO is super-easy, even with luggage (only $8.95 ticket vs uber/cab likely $40-60. [I suggest you treat yourself to some yummy treats from See's Candies with the money you save! ;-)] 2). Check-in: pretty fast, straightforward and pleasant. 3). Room: Sound proofing and cleanliness good. A decent sized, empty in-room fridge was appreciated to store my own drinks and food in. There were also loads of towels - and a great sized safe. 4). SOME of the staff.... including Jennie and Scott on Front Desk, both of whom were very helpful and pleasant. NEGATIVES 1). Room Allocation: I was very disappointed with my initial room on check-in. Yes, it had a 'bit' of a view but was MUCH smaller than I'd expected considering: a) it was supposed to be an upgrade of an upgrade (ie the category upgrade via the promotion when I booked, plus the upgrade apparently given by Customer Services in advance); b) the website image against my room category; c) the expectation given by the Check-in Desk guy when he told me I'd been assigned \"a really lovely room\". [I suspect now that that's just standard, superficial commentary...but I'd just landed in the US so wasn't yet 'acclimatised', shall we say, so I took it as face value at the time!] I popped back to Reception and was advised that all the rooms with a view in my category (whichever that was now!) are smaller than those that don't. Floor space is compromised. However, the guy kindly gave me a key card to view an alternative 'internal' room without a view (and in the same category as my original booking, I assume) and I decided to shift my stuff there instead: the 'view' in the 'upgraded' room was nothing much, easily sacrificed for a bit more leg space. 2). Room: Very limited storage space. Strange gimmicky and impractical 'suitcase' drawers under the bedside tables which you have to bend down to and the lids don't stay open on their own as your filling them etc, so you have to hold it with your elbow/one hand as your in and out! 3) Bathroom: tiny. No drawers to put anything in; I ended up taking the hairdryer out of it's box so I could put stuff away without cluttering all the surfaces. 4). Some staff... eg over-inflated, self-important attitude. [You know what it's like in some luxury/5* establishments where a few of the staff convey the impression that you're lucky to be there....!?*] 5). Check out issues including charging my credit card TWICE and effectively putting me overdrawn with my new bank!! Not helpful: if I'd been stuck on a flight - or if I hadn't the morning after I checked out spontaneously and casually decided to review my account online, I'd have been stuffed. Thankfully I was still in the city so I jumped straight out of bed (literally!) and rushed over to the hotel, subsequently wasting in total two hours of my life trying to sort it out .... Not something I particularly wanted to be doing whilst on holiday! :-( The first person on Front Desk had a completely uninterested attitude about her [*see above! one of a few] so I moved over to someone else. The hotel initially insisted only one charge had been taken, so I had to 'prove' two by showing screen shots of my online account which clearly reflected two payments ready. I also then rang my UK bank who confirmed two draw applications, both going through that day which would have put me overdrawn by c. ¬£800. I then spent almost an hour on the phone - standing all this time at the main public Front Desk - passing the phone back and forth between the hotel staff and me. The bank advised the only way one of the incorrectly duplicated payments could be removed was via a fax directly from the hotel stating as such. The hotel said the Front Desk Manager would need to do this - so, further delay as he was initially in a meeting, then he had to craft a suitably worded fax, then there were failed attempts at sending it (due to him not knowing he had to put a '9' in front of the number first...and then that he had to drop the '0' in the UK number... and then with the UK end being continually busy.) Eventually I had to leave, somewhat reluctantly but purely trusting a promise from the Manager that he'd email me later, in between his meetings, to confirm the fax had gone through - which he did - and knowing that Jennie, on Front Desk, was also now involved (she was reassuringly competent and down to earth!). The hotel has given me some points towards a future SPG stay. However, I won't be returning to this \"Luxury Collection\" hotel. I'd politely suggest it concentrates on getting more of the basics right... and don't be mean (eg room size for price & stay duration; and storage space). Hello and thank you taking the time to share such detailed feedback with us! We value the opinion of our guest so much and truly appreciate your comments regarding your recent visit. I will be sure to relay everything mentioned to the management team and address each issue accordingly. Wishing you the best with future travels, Jamie E.",

I didn't want a lot of maid service and my privacy was always respected. I asked for a fridge and they delivered it. There is no microwave in the room but I didn't find that any big deal. There is one downstairs for your use. It's not in a bad area although the Tenderloin is a block away. I always felt very very safe. I loved the restaurant downstairs with owners Ryan and Georgianna and chef Gary. Try the roast beef, heavenly. The staff worked so well with me even as I had to keep changing my dates due to my son's illness. I've been to San Francisco many many times and this is my new favorite place.",

It is more of a boutique hotel, so if this is what you are after, you have come to the right place. The price was fairly reasonable. The rooms were fairly comfy, though did have a charming allure. The elevators are older and not very spacious, though this added to the charm. The downside of being an older building is that the walls are paper thin so this can be hard with sleeping at night or not waking up early. Also the rooms get quite hot and this can make it hard to sleep at night. There is free wine offered in the early evenings in the lobby, and even some jazz music, but we found the atmosphere to not be very lively and opted to not join those festivities.",

Location is good, however expect to walk and walk and walk wherever you are in San Francisco.. the hills are a killer! One word-UBER!

San Francisco was the final destination of our 10-day trip, and by the time we reached Hotel Carlton we were due for a relaxing, comfortable stay. Hotel Carlton definitely delivered. They surprised us with a complimentary stay in their suite when we checked-in because apparently their King beds were already booked. This was much appreciated and a very nice (unexpected) ending to the trip! I definitely cannot promise this would happen every time. The hotel has a very \"worldly, cultural\" theme as its decor, which enhanced its appeal as a boutique hotel. The hotel also had a bar/restaurant inside which looked really nice. Unfortunately, by the time we arrived we were only able to grab a drink at the bar and not the food, but it's definitely a place we would have considered trying for breakfast or lunch (probably would have ventured out elsewhere for dinner). The only reason Hotel Carlton didn't get a perfect score was because I felt unsure about the area. When checking-in, the receptionist advised we do not park our rental car on the street because his car previously got broken in to. Although I certainly appreciated the feedback, it made me feel a little weary of the area we were staying in. Because we were only staying for one night, I didn't research the area as thoroughly as I should have, although of course anything can happen when staying in the city so incidents like that should be expected! The walls were also a bit thin, so in the morning we could hear some bustling in the hallways. Other than that, our stay at Hotel Carlton was very pleasant, and I think most people would really appreciate the unique ambiance of this hotel.",

I don't know how much this hotel cost, it was part of a package, but I'm told it's reasonable and if I go back to San Francisco, I'd definitely stay here.",

I am not sure what it would be like if it were very hot - there is no AC. But it was fine when I stayed. I would have liked a fridge in the room. The soundproofing is not great, but I used earplugs and slept very well on the large and comfortable bed. There is free wine and entertainment in the evenings, and the hotel has a nice restaurant serving very good beers and wines. I did not have much time to explore the area. It was a 15 minute walk to the main shopping area, and a 20 minute walk to Fishermans wharf. Overall I enjoyed my stay here.",

The hotel went through some renovations a couple years ago and it's a unique boutique style with a European feel. The staff is super friendly and helpful. It's walking distance to Union Square and central to getting around the city. Breakfast in the restaurant is really good. Haven't had dinner there. If you get a city view room you'll be off the street which is a busy street but not terribly noisy, just usual city noise. They have a wine hour in the lobby with local musicians. You can request a refrigerator in your room as they don't come with one, nor a mini bar but wine hour makes up for that and there's a liquor store up the street. There is a discount if you call to reserve your room 30 days in advance.",

The first night there was someone next door and could hear they were talking. Don't think anyone was in the room the other nights, and it was quiet. We also had a room facing the interior, so heard no street/city noises. -Staff: was friendly and welcoming Overall, the stay was fine - I booked directly through the hotel and got a good deal; at the Hotel's more typical rate, however, I would have reconsidered the value.",

The lobby is a bit of a non-event and I had minimal interaction with staff. They never even seemed to notice me during my entire stay. Which for me is great, others might find it less than welcoming. The lifts are dated and claustrophobic. There is a water filter dispenser on every second? floor which is actually a great amenity. I did not use the bar or restaurant so no feedback on those. The room itself was clean and fairly modern, walls and doors are a bit then as reported by others so you will hear outside noise. The bathroom seemed recently renovated and coming from Europe it was perfectly spacious. Others might find it cramped. There is no a/c but the ceiling fan did not disturb me and I never felt too warm in the room even though the weather was great! The area directly outside the hotel is fine but head a couple of blocks towards Market St and things deteriorate quickly. For the casual tourist this might be off-putting. Overall for a business trip and for someone who knows the city fairly well and is used to it's 'uniqueness' I would recommend this hotel. Particularly on budget. For tourists planning a first break in San Francisco I would probably recommend something closer to Union Square or lower Market St. Hello Mick, Thank you for choosing the Hotel Carlton as your home base in San Francisco! I am glad you were able to take advantage of our water stations and ceiling fans. Since the Hotel Carlton is a LEED certified Green hotel, we do our best to minimize our environmental foot print. As for the elevators, the Carlton was built in the 1920's so the layout and shape of the hotel does carry it's own historic design. Thank you for recommending your hotel. I hope we see you again the next time you're in SF! Warmest Regards, Akiko M.",

We (a family of 3) liked: The location on Sutter and Larkin which meant that Union Square was walkable in about 10 to 12 minutes and China town in 20 minutes. Two blocks up Larkin on California there is a Trader Joe's supermarket which is wonderful for food and drink (and the hotel has a microwave). Opposite Trader Joe's there is the Today laundromat which is safe clean and cheap. Very close to the hotel- less than 2 minutes- there is a breakfast diner and a Papa John's. Walk down Sutter and in a few minutes you are in Little Saigon- I recommend the Golden Lotus on Larkin and Willow for Vietnamese. The humour, the friendliness and helpfulness of all the staff that we came into contact with. They tried to give us early check-in and late check out where they could do so and organised us a good value taxi to San Francisco Airport. The capsule coffee machine in the room with 4 free capsules a day and the hot and cold filtered water machines and ice machines on most floors. The free wine and music sessions every afternoon in the lobby where there were comfortable settees and a fire during (it was April) The speed and reliability of the free Internet. The decor of the hotel which was definitely not bland without being pretentious. The size and cleanliness of the room ( a twin double) and the efficiency of the cleaning staff. It is an old hotel and that is part of its charm along with its quirky decor. However as other reviewers have noted the walls are thin and if guests talk loudly and slam doors the noise travels. However we were never disturbed and always slept soundly. This hotel made our stay memorable.",

Only negative was that you could hear everything going on outside your room e.g toilet flushing, curtains being closed etc. Location was convenient and there was a laundromat close by, less than 5 minute walk. Hotel is vintage and you get the feel it has loads of history . Would definitely recommend this hotel for short stays in San Francisco. Hi Shan, Thank you for your feedback! The Hotel Carlton was built in the 1920's and has a rich history that we reflect in the hotel's aesthetic. As for the noise, we are continuously renovating and improving the quality of this historic building. We hope to see you back again! Yours Truly, Akiko",

Gorgeous lobby, friendly, relaxed vibe. GREAT staff. The front desk guy, Theo McKinney, apparently started something called \"Local Vocals\" about 8 years ago, providing a place for musicians to share their music. It's been a huge success. The following evening I was playing a set there myself (I'm a singer/songwriter and there happened to be a last minute open slot.) Long story short, it was an amazing experience followed by a fantastic dinner in their restaurant, Phlox Commons. I'll actually be back there again on Saturday, April 8th, playing songs from my upcoming album. And no doubt having dinner at Phlox. This place is a jewel. If I didn't already live in San Francisco, I'd be staying here whenever I visited. Check it out .... Hi Ken! Thank you so much for your kind words. We at Hotel Carlton celebrate the arts and our local artists. This has been a passion project for Theo and I'm glad you are able to contribute some of your own beautiful music to Local Vocals!

We were able to check in an hour early and check out an hour late which was much appreciated. There was live music and free wine in the lobby from 530-630 which was beautiful by the fire. The housekeeping staff were lovely. The one negative: the noise. Our door did not seal any sounds out from the hallway. Other guests coming home were noisy at times and I can understand how this might be disruptive. San Francisco seems to have a fire engine drive past with sirens every five minutes so if you are easily woken perhaps this isn't the hotel for you. For us, severely jet lagged, we did not much mind and it didn't detract from our stay. The hotel is within walking distance of union square (about a kilometre), however, it took us some getting used to the San Francisco hills for this to be a comfortable walk! We used uber to get around and found hotel Carlton was around the middle of the union square area and the other districts such as Fishermans wharf and Columbus street. Overall, we had a great stay and the hotel was perfect for us. Thank you Hotel Carlton for making our stay so pleasant.",

I chose not have daily housekeeping service since I really did not need it. I would request towels and trash pickup when necessary and the hotel staff was quick to answer and quick to deliver. Everyone at the San Francisco Marriott Marquis was friendly and knowledgeable. One staff member who works in the Mission Street Pantry (forgot her name!), went above and beyond the call of duty brought bananas and Gatorade to my room since I was suffering from leg spasms. I called concierge to ask if the Pantry would bring those items up to me and I was told by a gentleman that it was not a service offered by the Pantry. He said he would ask management and call me back. Instead of a call, the young lady from the Pantry was knocking at my door within minutes. I was so relieved to that she came up to deliver the items, as I was in terrible pain. She was super nice and inquired about me the next time she saw me in the Pantry.

When I got back to my room, I realized my meal was missing something. What a horrible use of technology to replace good customer service! I'm now going up and down the elevators. If you hit the \"At Your Service\" button on the phone, it directs you to the Wake Up call service. If you eliminate \"At Your Service\", eliminate the buttons! I could get the same experience at a Holiday Inn for half the price. I used to love this hotel but it looks like I'll need to move somewhere else in SF.

There is already a paucity of light and choice of dark colors for wooden upholstery and wall papers make the rooms darker still. I stayed here for 5 nights and the place was gloomy. Access to the elevators was also through snaking corridors. There is something called \"in room dining\" wherein when you order your food, you have to go downstairs to pick it up! Imagine! Plus being in downtown, this place is expensive to stay. A client was paying for my stay as they were hosting me for a conference. Otherwise, I wouldnt bother with this hotel.

Happy hour consists of almost a full dinner with a different theme each night. Desserts are served later in the evening and are to die for. All of the employees are super friendly and helpful. My girls had some trouble with the Uber app locating them and the concierge was wonderful and helped them out.

We booked 2 queens, which are only available on lower floors, whereas higher floors have 2 doubles or a king. We were still on the 16th floor, so nice views. They have 3 elevator groups and the mid-level goes up to floor 17 with the higher going to 39. Never more than a moment wait for elevator. Can't say that at much smaller properties.

Of course we also greatly appreciated the room upgrade to a suite when we arrived, the location which allowed us to walk about everywhere we wanted to go, the conference rooms were superb, and the view from the View lounge on floor 39 is astounding. We did not eat in the regular restaurant so can't comment on that.

The customer service was bad! My colleagues and I were staying at the hotel for a conference and our administrative assistant put a hold on the room with the university credit card. When we checked in at the hotel, they said they needed a credit card authorization, stating we should have known because it was in the fine print. (We booked through the organization putting on the conference and the authorization form was mentioned nowhere on the reservation confirmation of the hotel.). The clerk went on to tell us this had happened to several other people. Since it was Saturday, we could not take care of it until Monday. During the several times that we had to deal with the clerks at the front desk, they were unhelpful and, sometimes even, rude. Only one person (Rey) seemed genuinely interested in helping us. When everything was finally resolved they mentioned this had happened to 30-40 other people from the conference. This might be a hint that it was not in the reservation confirmation and the hotel should take some of the blame for the problem. One more thing- the walkway going to the conference center (that was part of the hotel) smelled like sewar. Not a great way to start your day. We appreciate you choosing the Marriott Marquis for your recent business travels, jmd195.

I can't fault the meeting facilities, but what very much put me off was the conspicuous police presence in the lobby every day and every night: there were cops with visible badges and handcuffs at the ready patrolling the crowds and eyeing people coming and going from the toilets and the lifts - not the sort of environment where one can feel at ease. The little hotel across the street, in contrast, seems much less impersonal. The city centre location is convenient: families should try the nearby Yerba Buena children's garden and museum, and every attraction is accessible from Powell Street BART station or via the Muni buses. For laundry much cheaper than in the hotel, and decent coffee and wifi to boot, try BrainWash, a combination launderette and cafe half a mile south on Folsom Street. For a truly excellent (but expensive) sandwich, try Split Bread at the front of the Metreon on 4th Street. For cheaper food try the Target inside the Metreon or the Trader Joe's on 4th Street just southeast of Market Street. Thank you for taking a moment to share your review, Matthew.

We were on the 2nd floor with a lovely big room. The only downside was that there was a charge for Wi-Fi in the room, but when we complained about this at customer services, we were given a complimentary code to use during our stay. The only time we ate in the hotel was a couple of breakfasts. Although it was busy we were seated quickly, served coffee and fruit juice and the rest was a serve yourself buffet of which there was plenty. The location of the hotel is excellent, a short walk to the main shopping area, or cable car if you wanted it. We walked most of the time in San Francisco, again well situated as we were able to walk straight down Mission Street to the Embarcadero. All in all a fabulous hotel which we would be very happy to return to if in the area again.",

Kudos to Grace, Elizabeth, Rey, Bella, Brenda, Lando, Ricky, Ra and Joe and all the housekeeping staff who serviced our room. The room was spacious clean comfy and well lit. A/C worked evey well. We always felt like going 'home' to our room after a long day of touring. Location also gets high marks! A starbucks, Mel'sdiner and Target were just around the corner. Just right across was a cinema and a food court that served Fil food:-). A few blocks away was Market and Powell sts with a lot of stores and shops around like Trader Joes, Old Navy, sephora, MAC, Ross and Nordstrom rack etc. Just walking distance to Union square or you can take a cable car ride at Powell st. Convenient area yet it wasnt as busy or crowded as Union Square. The only downside was bfast wasnt included in the rate and food in the hotel was quite pricey even at the pantry:-( but no prob for us as we had a lot of dining options around the area.

I had a lovely corner room with beautiful views of old and new architecture of the City. The windows slide open for fresh air; loved that. Also, the windows were very clean! I was on the 22nd floor. The sunset is beautiful and the room turns into a golden hue. My two daughters in adjoining room. Hotel was busy so I was happy we got our adjoining room for our Mother's Day visit. Very comfy bed (mine: king; daughters: two room double beds). Huge TV with great reception and selection. There is a breakfast and snack area for Rewards guests but some confusion on which level: gold or silver. No one seemed to know. But it's great if you can find it. The Marquis website is very outdated. For example, NO BUSINESS CENTER! Yes, most have travel info on phone, but I am a senior traveler and still like to print my airline pass. This property business center is in a dark hallway with no chair to sit on and near a kitchen. Weirdest business center ever. The atrium on their website does not exist anymore. The first night there, we went to The View Lounge and it was packed but if you wait and watch, grab a window table when someone leaves. The hotel was very nice when learning I was there on Mothers Day with my two daughters. Saying: Happy Mother's Day\" etc. It was a great weekend. The hotel is centrally located to what we visited.

Our rooms were not ready, but they took down our number and texted us when it was. We were in our rooms by 1:30. 2. The concierge and the bell staff: Friendly, funny, helpful and gave great recommendations! 3. The location: Perfect for shopping. It's right next to Westfield, Macy's, etc. About 2.4 miles from Fisherman's Wharf and Pier 39 where you can go for some fantastic food (My recommendation would be Fog Harbor Fish House). You can take an uber, or ride down the cable car (I'd recommend Uber. Cable Cars are slow and boring). 4. The rooms - great views of the city. Big and spacious rooms with incredibly comfortable beds. They use Thann Products (Very good luxury brand from Thailand) in the bathroom. So you come out feeling squeaky clean and ready to explore the wonderful city! 5. Checkout: It was quick. We had a lot of luggage, so this incredibly helpful doorman helped us get a fixed-rate Cadillac Escalade which took us to the airport. There's a taxi stand right outside the hotel if you prefer taking a regular taxi instead. I honestly can't think of any way this hotel could've served us better.

You don't need a car! We took the Bart from the Airport $8.95, we took the Muni every place else in the city $2.25. Buy your tickets on your phone, it couldn't be simpler. Golden Gate Park, Lands End, Pier 39, any area in the city for dinner, your limitations are your own. Want to go to Muir Woods, that bus leaves from Union Square. Want a great view and a great drink to wind down at the end of your day, thats up on the 39th floor, The View.

Attending a Banking Conference which meant all of its facilities were pretty well sold out, I was scheduled to arrive very late and I requested the GM to hold decent rooms for a late arrival as well as print out some last minute event information for me. What an incredible surprise to have GM Tomey, who was travelling himself out of the country and on vacation, respond back immediately with a welcome note and assurance that I would be taken care of by his hotel staff. Service by staff was as good as I have experienced anywhere worldwide! When I checked in, I was met by Vanna who personally escorted me to my room where received my faxes and some refreshments given the late hour. This sort of personal attention I normally only find in Asia in the best of class Hotels and it was my first reminder at the Fairmont, that this property was as good as any worldwide. I them spoke to the operator regarding the gym and internet and she volunteered that I should join the President's Club for free which gave me complementary internet and gym access during my stay. The Internet connection was super-fast and the gym was large with enough room for easy access to various machines during my stay. During my 2 days, staff at the restaurant, bar, gift store, bell desk, room service all were super friendly and always asking what else they could do to help. This type of Excellence starts at the top and as I noted, their GM clearly sets the example. This Hotel is located in Nob Hill, an excellent location to stay and visit this great city, with spectacular lobbies, foyers, rooms with magnificent early morning views of the Golden gate Bridge, Alcatraz and the Ocean. Outside access to taxis, Uber, trams all get you to where you want to go quickly. It‚Äôs a Historic Hotel full of great memories. The Venetian Room at the Fairmont Hotel was where Tony Bennett first sang \"I Left My Heart in San Francisco\" in December 1961. The Hotel was used to film many shows such as Hotel and the Rock. It‚Äôs full of history and if you see the movie Bullitt you will recognize many of the surrounding streets. My big regret is not having my wife visit with me as this was a Business trip. But it is definitely on my list for us to visit together and for any of you reading this review, I highly recommend a stay to feel pampered and feel transported to a time when true luxury was and is still defined by hotels like the Fairmont. Thank you for your extremely kind words about the hotel! We're thrilled to hear your return trip was so lovely and that you appreciated the engaging service we are known for. We are very fortunate to have Mr. Tormey as our GM and I know you agree. Thank you again for your exceedingly kind review. I look forward to sharing with the team, they'll be thrilled to hear it.

Walking in to the magnificent foyer to staying in a suite over looking the bay was more than we ever imagined. Everyone from the front desk to the concierge to the service staff was totally exceptional. There was never once that I felt like I was asking too much or that it was my problem. Changing suites because of a soiled couch to sending IT and bringing rice when I spilled coffee on my laptop never seemed to be an issue. We were able to visit the Tonga room and have a nice Mi Tai which were probably the best we had ever had. The restaurant recommendations given were always one's we enjoyed as well as getting tickets for us seemed effortless for the concierge. Our room had the best view in San Fransisco so our last evening we just ordered in. It was exceptional. From the white table cloth on our dining room table to serving us a wonderful meal of salmon, it was memorable. You may find the hotel pricey but work with them. We are member 's of the President's club and it is totally worth the money we spend for the upgrade.

It's very impressive and delivers everything you would expect from a five star hotel with the added bonus of perfect location and historic significance. Highly recommended but very expensive for food and parking even for SF. Look for deals for the room rate as they seem to vary a lot. Service: Perfect. About as good as it gets. Food: Seemed excellent but expensive as you would expect. Room: Excellent. Not a single thing as a drawback. Architecture/Lobby: Very impressive. Buillt in 1903 as the first Fairmont. Very grand. Location: Tough to beat. Top of Nob Hill. Next to cable car and near everything. I would put it at the top of my list for the place to stay in the City! Thank you for your very kind words about the hotel. We're thrilled to hear you had such a nice visit and enjoyed such great service. As you mentioned we are the first Fairmont (opened in 1907) and have much of that storied past on display throughout the hotel.

      "content": "I've been visiting the Fairmont San Francisco a couple times every year for the last five years, and always spend a week at what my wife and I call our second home during the Thanksgiving holiday. Everything is top notch as one would expect in a five star hotel, and I especially appreciate the ambiance and eloquence of staying at this historically significant hotel. The buffet breakfast served is truly one of the best in town! The hotel is quiet, the mattresses firm, and the concierge service is friendly, knowledgable, and helpful. But sometimes there's one event or one person that pulls all of the excellence together and makes a stay extraordinary and memorable. For my wife and I, that's Scott Bellamy who works at the front desk. It was impressive that after our first stay, Scott would greet me by name. It took no time at all for Scott to figure out what we liked and I've also found his off of the beaten path restaurants suggestions to be consistently excellent. He always seems to have an interesting story about the history of the hotel and my wife and I ended up buying a book that they have on the history of the Fairmont! So while it's the hundreds of staff at the Fairmont that makes for an excellent experience, Scott is the one that pulls things together and makes us feel like we're coming home, each time we visit! Thank you for your very kind words about the hotel and for being such a loyal guest. As we pride ourselves on delivering engaging service, I'm thrilled to hear of you interactions with the staff and Scott in particular.

Each time I stay at the Fairmont, I feel like a special and cherished customer and my experience is excellent. This is primarily due to two people, Mr. Scott Bellamy at the front desk and Mr. William Mays at the front of the hotel. Scott is the epitome of customer service. He knows my likes and dislikes and makes sure that I am well accommodated each stay. He even calls me each time after I arrive in my room to make sure everything is well. You can't ask for better customer service than that. William greets me warmly and professionally when I come out of the hotel each morning and often offers me the house car, a perk that is highly coveted, and highly appreciated by me. I heartily recommend the Fairmont San Francisco for anyone who is looking for a hotel experience a cut above the rest. Thank you for your very kind words about the hotel and for being such a loyal guest. I'm pleased to hear you had such a nice stay and enjoyed great service.

What they did not mention is that the Crown Room is on the 24th floor. Noisy!! You hear weddings, or whatever else is booked, until midnight. Or later. For the price of this room, I think the noise is unacceptable. Don't get me wrong--the view is spectacular! I don't know if they have Tower Suites on the 22nd or 21st floors, but if they do, take those!! We had two out of three really noisy nights!

The staff seem to features some long-time gems, including the concierge staff and Ivan the resident limo driver, more of Ivan later. Everyone bent over backwards but I understand current ownership like a Tripadviser Review to show appreciation, which I can happily demonstrate except with the on-line sign-in system for their Fairmont \"Presidents Club\" and the current tie up with the gym. In fact, while the hotel seems luxurious and well maintained, especially for such a vast property, the gym needs expansion and an upgrade. It's main room is bursting at the seems with machines, but smells sweaty and there is almost no floor space to lie down for stretches etc when you are not using the equipment, It functions as a Club for non-hotel guests, which perhaps leads to unnecessary complications for hotel guests trying to use it. Whether or not the guest joins the Presidents Club, and gives us email and other personal details, a hotel of this calibre should off FREE wifi in this day and age, and FREE use of the gym. But apparently this is not the current system, which seems fussy and makes for misunderstandings and delays when guests try to explain their way into the gym. The positives though were generally friendly staff, excellent shops, lovely public spaces and quite a decent menu and standard at the bar and restaurant, gorgeous style and location. Plus Ivan's effort tp engage and offer outgoing guests a smooth ride to the airport at the end of my visit left the vagaries of Uber and regular taxis in the dust. So there must be something great about working for the Fairmont, and given it's wonderful location on Nob Hill we hope to be back!

My pre-stay email for an upgrade was replied to promptly and granted without even using my certificates. Once there, the dedicated check in staff for club members was extremely cordial and even followed up during my stay to ensure my satisfaction. I was happy with my room upgrade, which was in the newer tower on a high floor with breathtaking views. Finally, the building itself is truly gorgeous and a historical landmark. That is the end of what I liked about the hotel and the only reason it is getting 4 stars from me. The rest, unfortunately, was underwhelming. While the bedroom had been renovated, the bathroom hadn't. The bedroom part was current and tasteful but the bathroom was outdated. At $400 a night for a standard room, you'd expect more. The gym is also disappointing. Outsourced to a third party it would appear, it is not inviting and had out of service equipment. It was free to me (likely due to my status) but a colleague had to pay. Again, disappointing in a hotel of that caliber and price. I also wish there was a pool. I think there was one but an (average) tiki restaurant was built around it? Really? And the hotel needs general sprucing up. Carpets in public rooms, paint, etc. Lots feels like it needs attention. Thank you for your kind rating of the hotel. While I'm pleased you had a nice stay overall, I am sorry to hear of some of the challenges you experienced. I thank you for your candid feedback about the condition of the hotel and have shared it with the team. Thank you and we hope to welcome you again in the future. Sincerely, Lucas",

      "content": "Apart from the classic interiors and luxury experience I enjoyed at the Fairmont, three incidents stand out in my memory for mention. First, I would like to commend Helena at the front desk for gracefully resolving a sticky situation she was not responsible for when the bay view room I'd been assured of by global reservation was not given to me at check-in (after I cancelled my Hyatt bay view on their assurance). It was my first time in SF and I was crestfallen. Helena went the extra mile to find me a bay view room and, importantly, did this with so much cheer that it set the tone for my entire stay. Nick, the Manager, also went way beyond his duty by extending my checkout until 3pm since my int'l flight was delayed and I wanted to visit Muir Woods. Though I asked only for 2pm, he said he didn't want me to have to rush and set it for 3 on his own. (I ended up checking out at 3:05 because everything went down to the wire, and Nick's generous foresight saved the day!) It was the Fairmont Concierge who answered my multiple calls from the road to find, contact and direct me to an alternative Budget drop off location when Budget wasn't answering my calls minutes before I had to rush to the airport. All in all, I'm now a lifetime fan of the Fairmont and will never stay anywhere else in SF. Thank you for taking the time to comment on your recent stay with us. We're thrilled to hear you had such a nice visit and enjoyed great service from the team. As we pride ourselves on delivering engaging service, it's great to hear of your encounters with the staff.

There is a large bar in the basement that attracts a lot of screeching 20 and 30somethings - to be avoided.

The Fairmont has been a tradition in my family, but this is the first time I've ever stayed there as a hotel guest. The Tonga Room is the best. The Christmas time life sized gingerbread house is the best. But to stay here as a guest and pay these prices, is a poor option, and not just for SF Bay Area standards but also for Europe and North America. Common on, at these prices you have to pay for in-room wifi and valet parking parking??? What a rip-off! The food is okay but nothing to write home about and at these prices, just forget about it. There's world class food, drinks, coffee all around the City. Spend your money on restaurants outside the hotel. They charge you for removing any item from the room refrigerator. Even if you pick it up to look at the label, you are charged for it. They stock the refrigerator so full there's no room for any drinks or cheeses you might want to bring in from any of the fantastic delis from around the City. They don't even provide a clean plastic liner for the ice bucket, so that if you want clean ice, for certain clean, you either have to clean out the ice bucket yourself or bring your own bag. The bathrooms are old and water pressure is awful. They keep the spare roll of toilet paper in the closet, not even in the bathroom! We paid extra for the Garden Room view. OK yes, we could see a garden, if we walked close up to the window, craned our necks, and looked right, we could see a beautiful garden Yeez, common on Fairmont. You're an embarrassment to us locals.

      "content": "In planning my trip to San Francisco in December 2016 during the holiday season, I thought long and hard about the many choices of fine hotels that SF offers. Knowing the city rather well, I considered them all and finally decided that the fabled Fairmont would be a perfect place to perch for a week. I was not disappointed. First the Fairmont literally sits on the top of Nob Hill the most prominent of the many hills of the city. If you are not a walker or have mobility problems, plan on waiting for cable cars that run on California Street, or city buses, or take cabs which are always available at the hotel. I am a walker and considered it both a challenge and exercise to make my way up to the hotel after long days of touring the city. I chose the Fairmont particularly because of its fabled location and its reputation. Because this was a special trip that I hoped would be a memorable re-connection with a city I love, I decided to go all in and stay at one of the grand old hotels of San Francisco's glory days. The Fairmont did not disappoint. The lobby is indeed very grand. At the holiday season it was decked out with a huge tree and festoons and garlands. Check in was speedy and efficient and while my room did not offer a city view, I settled in nicely in a quiet corner of the hotel and was perfectly happy to find myself in an almost cul de sac room. The bathroom was completely up to the mark with a big tub and good hotel products and towels. There was also a huge closet with a safe. One iffy note, I found the remote on the television rather herky jerky and testy which was annoying but I made do. The lobby was always busy and active, esp. at this time of the year. Families and tourists posing in front of the tree was a big draw and I rather liked all the activity. The hotel was quite full with holiday revelers and the elevators were always full in the evenings with beautifully dressed people off to events and parties. There is a fine restaurant off the lobby, but more importantly for me there is also a casual small cafe which one reaches via the elevator to the ground floor down a long corridor. It served as the right beginning of the day for me, little fuss, good coffee and croissants etc and that was all I needed to start the day. Sadly there was no swimming pool. It had long ago become a ballroom. It did not deter me from choosing the Fairmont. All together it was the right hotel for me and one I would recommend for those seeking a complete San Francisco experience. A last note, I booked through my travel agent who contacted the hotel to tell them that she expected me to be offered all the amenities. After a glitch I did receive the daily newspapers etc and I found the concierge's desk in the lobby most helpful regarding directions, and recommendations. I am a purposeful directed traveler but it is always good to have back up and the desk was very helpful. There are many grand hotels in San Francisco. I made the right choice. Thank you for your very kind words about the hotel. I'm pleased to hear you had such a nice stay and enjoyed great service. As you mentioned, the holidays are a very special time at the hotel. The Gingerbread House in particular makes the hotel a world-famous destination. I'm also pleased you were able to experience so much of what the property has to offer. Thanks again for your very kind feedback and we hope to welcome you again in the future. Sincerely, Lucas",

The female staff member that checked us into our room (around 4-5pm) was very kind and diligent. I stayed in room 231, a single queen standard. The room itself was very clean and had a nice light rose scent from the toiletries that they provide. The coffee, tea, and snack bar is well stocked with a wide variety. The hotel was very quiet and I had no problems with noise from other guests and did not even notice or hear the water running from bathroom's in nearby rooms. The room is provided with bathrobes when you arrive. The closet is a decent size with shelving. I really enjoyed the bath toiletries provided and was given an extra set by the cleaning staff on my way out. The bed was very comfortable and I had a great night's rest. They have 24/7 in-dining available. I ordered the children's pepperoni pizza, regular burger, cheese plate, children's cookie and soy milk. The order was placed early Thursday evening and arrived about 25 minutes later. The staff member that delivered the food was very kind, professional, and had great attention to detail. In regards to the food, it was okay, nothing special. I would not order the pizza again. I did enjoy the cheese plate however very much. The buffet breakfast at Laurel Court was delicious and very fresh. I received some of the best customer service here. My cups were always full and my silverware was changed in between courses. The variety of food available for breakfast is quite large and of great quality. The cheese selection at the buffet was even better than the room service cheese plate that I ordered the evening prior. There is also smoked salmon, waffles, pancakes, and omelettes in addition to an array of pastries. My only complaint is that the extra toiletries took about 30 mins to be delivered to our room. Also, the mirror inside of the dry bar behind the Keurig had smudge marks on it, which is a minor detail and can easily be fixed. Tip: Make a reservation for The Tonga Room during happy hour. They only have a standing bar and you do not want to stand. Thank you for your very kind words about the hotel. I'm pleased to hear you had such a nice stay and enjoyed great service. I'm particularly happy to hear of your experience in Laurel Court and will definitely share your kind words with the team. Thanks again and we hope to welcome you again in the future.

It's 10 minutes walk into Union Square(however I would recommend getting a tram back, those hills are severe) and 15 minutes walk the other way down to fisherman's wharf. Lots to do and see great pubs and restaurants and of course Alcatraz but book it on line before you travel. A 3/4 day visit would be my recommendation as part of a traveling holiday. Thank you for taking the time to comment on your recent stay with us. I'm pleased to hear you had such a nice visit to the hotel and found the location well-suited to your needs.

Good advice from the concierge a couple of times for restaurants. Excellent service during breakfast. Room clean and comfortable, and very important, could no hear any noise from other rooms or from outside. It is expensive, the accommodation, the breakfast but you get what comes with the price. Only one warning : Hotel is located on top of the hill (Nob Hill). You must walk and down all the time so must be relatively in shape. If not either you take a taxi, which is a shame if you want to visit the city, or choose a hotel closer to the shore where the hill is not as steep. Thank you for your very kind words about the hotel. We're pleased to hear you had such a nice sty and enjoyed great service from the staff.

But once you get into standard/superior rooms, the feeling is much less impressive: I had a small, corner room on a high floor with no view (basically the window was in front of a wall from the same hotel) with little light and classic/oldish furniture. Service was kind and just average from what I have experienced at reception and with the bar. Wi-fi connection was charged (not free). Not terrible, not great - just average. That was my experience at the Fairmont. I am not sure I was looking for that. Thank you for taking the time to comment on your recent stay with us.

The only slight complaint I have is that our room's window treatment was a thin white cloth that let in the early morning light.

While checking in the front desk was empty except for the one staff member at the Presidents Club check in. He promptly called me over and was extremely helpful.Check in was a breeze and Scott (the staff member) was able to upgrade me to a bigger room. He made sure to ask me if I needed any assistance with anything at all. Super friendly and it felt like I was speaking more to a friend than to an employee. Throughout my stay I recieved text messages checking on me to make sure everything was okay and to see if I needed anything. The hotel lobby is just gorgeous, it reminded me of the Savoy in London. We got a room in the tower on the 20th floor with a beautiful view of the water towards the Bay Bridge. It was a large room especially for San Francisco. The bathroom was nice with a separate shower and bath. Everything was clean and well appointed. To be honest the room was basic but nice. Nothing overly fancy, but thats fine. Lots of pillows on the bed and the sheets were fine. The only minor glitch in my mind was that I couldn't check out on the TV. There was some issue. So that meant I had to go downstairs and wait in line just to check out. I did see that I recieved an email that would've taken me to a check out site but it was too late. Overall the staff and the hotel met and exceeded my expectations. Beautiful hotel with a lot of history. Thank you for your very kind words about the hotel.

      "content": "We have been long-time Fairmont devotees and have been looking forward to visiting the \"flagship\" in San Francisco for years. Unfortunately we didn't experience the attention to detail and luxury Fairmont has been known for in the past. The hotel is certainly dated, and getting rough around the edges. We used an upgrade certificate and were upgraded to a suite, which had a large glassed in area that we could sit in outside. Unfortunately it was filthy out there, the cushions on the chairs were dirty and the floor was filthy. Our biggest issue with the hotel however was using dining certificates. Every year we plan our vacations and always make use of the frequent stay certificates and rewards that Fairmont provides, this year I had dining certificates I had saved up. On checking out I was told that these could not be used for in-room dining or for alcohol so essentially couldn't use most of them. When I asked when that changed she informed me it was up to each property. So much for vacation planning. We tried to eat in the Laurel Court dining room, however went in and sat down, someone threw an iPad on our dirty table and never came back. After 15 mins we got up and left. Definitely not like other Fairmont dining rooms. They do have neat tablets in the rooms you can use to order room service, but after the first day ours wouldn't work. Room service food was very good, definitely no extra touches though. I am a frequent visitor and other properties added cookies or even flowers on the tray, none of that here. Turn down service is done at 5-6pm, a ridiculously early time when we are normally still relaxing in our room or getting ready for dinner, so we were never able to take advantage of that. Last thing, the walls are crazy thin, there was a crying baby beside us and it sounded like she was in the same room, and two mornings in a row there was a crazy hammering noise on the other side like they were doing construction. The one thing that was amazing was the Tonga Room, a restaurant and bar in the Fairmont, definitely a must-do, but you don't have to stay there to do it! All in all, definitely a disappointing showing for the Fairmont. Perhaps it is just this property, but this was not the Fairmont experience I have enjoyed in the past. At $450/night, they should be bringing much more attention to detail. Thank you for taking the time to comment on your recent stay with us and for being a loyal Fairmont guest. Candid guest feedback is essential to our improvement as a hotel, so we appreciate yours. I am very sorry to hear of your experience with the dining certificates and can imagine the frustration that caused.

      "content": "We walked in the Hotel without having a reservation. They gave us a suite, as it was the only room available at the moment, at the price of 650$ per night. We stayed for 5 nights. The first day at the breakfast area we asked an employee if our room includes breakfast too! She kindly said yes, and after we finished having our breakfast, they brought us the receipt to sign. We asked why we needed to sign, since breakfast was included and they replied that we need to sign, in order for them to deduct the amount from our final bill at the check out. Therefore we took our breakfast there everyday. Our stay was very pleasant, service was good, hotel grounds were beautiful. Until the time of check out that we got extremely disappointed. In the analytic bill the last three nights were charged 150$ extra each than the first two nights without any notice. Furthermore, they had charged 90$ per day for breakfast, which of course if we knew we wouldn't have had breakfast in the hotel. We would have gone to different places everyday, especially at that amount. Finally, there was a daily charge of 20$ for the standard internet not for the fast speed internet again without any notice. All the above, sum up to the amount of 1000$ extra. When we requested for the manager to come in order to discuss our complaints, she immediately deducted the internet charges and extra room charges as she understood that they were completely out of context. I find it extremely unprofessional when visiting such a high end hotel for this mistakes to be made. If I didn't check my bill carefully, these \"mistakes\" could have costed me 550$. As far as the breakfast is concerned, she apologized for the miscommunication of her employee but did not deduct the charges for the breakfast which sum up to the amount of 450$ for 5 omelettes. Ridiculous! Its not our problem if their employees are not well informed. If the lady in the breakfast didn't know, she could have asked, or even just tell us to ask reception. I left very disappointed from the hotel, because of the manager's handling of the matter. A good manager in such hotels could have handled the matter immediately, and not disappoint the customer for a mistake of an employee. We left the hotel, leaving the bill open, expecting from them to call us in the next few hours in order to let us know their decision about the breakfast charges. Of course they didnt even call us the same day, but the next. After discussing for the 5th time the matter with another manager, she finally recognized their mistake and confirmed that no extra charges would be added to our bill and that she would send an email with our final bill. The funniest part is, that the matter did not end there! After an hour we received the final bill, with no breakfast charges, but with charges of \"smoking charges\" of 500$ which was not mentioned from anyone in the past and was not included in any of the previous bills. And why did these charges occur? Just because the housekeeper found in our garbage a bottle of water with cigarettes butts which we brought from the car in order to throw it away. I cannot believe, that after spending so much of my time dealing with this matter, explaining myself again and again, instead of them ending the matter there, they chose to find any excuse possible to find extra charges.. I have stayed in many 5 star hotels in my life and this is the first time of seeing such an unprofessional management, and such a bad internal communication between the employees. It's such a pity that this beautiful hotel is being managed by such people. Managers that could not care less about the reputation of their business.. I am not the type of person that writes bad reviews, this actually is my first one. But I have never been so disappointed, not even from 4 or 3 star hotels. Thank you for taking the time to comment on your recent stay with us. I apologize for the miscommunication you experienced during your visit. I can appreciate the frustration that caused and for that I am sorry. I am pleased we were able to rectify the situation and clear up the miscommunication concerning the charges. That being said, unfortunately we did find evidence of smoking in the room beyond what you mentioned in your review and we assessed the fee accordingly. Thank you again and I'm sorry your stay was not a more pleasant one. Sincerely, Lucas",

There is a terrace with spectacular views and the hotel is in a great location on Nob hill. Rooms are impressive and nicely decorated. The rest of the hotel I found to be a strange mix of connecting building/hallways that was not as impressive. Its a fun place to stay but probably pricey due to classic reputation.

The other house restaurants are fine, but SF is known for its fantastic cuisine, so go out. Staff is very good and attentive. Get a room in the Tower, which is the new section.

I guess being a little richer leaves me in an equitable mood. Don't get me wrong; it's a very nice hotel. Doormen, fancy restaurant/bar, spacious lounge area, concierge. It gives quite a fine impression. The room was clean and smelled good. I like the modern styling. But it's not very big. There are no dresser drawers besides three very small ones in the closet (I don't like living out of a suitcase for four days). The large blind that covers the sliding glass doors at night was a mystery until we found an unlabeled controller button halfway across the room next to the bed. Convenient, but we just got lucky figuring it out. The sink is needlessly weird and high. The tub was fiberglass/plastic (!) and had spots that pushed down a little when I stepped on them making an audible pop. The surface-mounted sliding bathroom door didn't fit tightly, allowing light and (ahem) noises out. These are all very, very minor issues. It's still a very nice hotel. Most other hotels with these piddly complaints would get five dots from me. But not any that charge $350/night or more. I'm sorry but even in San Francisco if I'm paying that much, I better be blown completely away. That room should be perfect in every possible way. Chocolates on the bed. Complimentary wine in the fridge. Maybe discounts on local attractions. I don't know - surprise me. That's what $350/night hotels do.",

For the positives, the room was nice, the staff cleaned it well, and the staff was generally very friendly. The gym on the 35th floor had a good mix of weights and cardio. A small negative was more than once, I was left a pile of decaffeinated coffee and only 1 or 0 packs of regular coffee. A small detail, but for the price point, I would expect this detail to be hit. The significant negative experience was the hotel Wi-Fi. There was an outage my 2nd night and 1st and 3rd mornings, which isn't great. The real bad experience here is that guests have to call the IT team directly, instead having the concierge tackle it, who then take you through a tier 1 support script (have you restarted your device, etc). The first time, the IT rep arranged a restart of the router, which fixed things. When I told this to the rep on the 2nd incident, he was a bit incredulous that he couldn't do that/arrange that. For the price point, I expect Wi-Fi to be solid and not to have to do 30 min+ of IT desk calls myself. Thank you for your feedback. We appreciate your kind words on are truly sorry for the inconvenience due to our unexpected Wi-Fi outage and the lack of regular coffee package in your guestroom.

It is not powerful enough to allow stable VPN connection into my company network. It keeps connecting and disconnecting. This is my second (and last) visit to this hotel. The same thing happened 2 months ago: I could not connect to the wifi. Had to run to the Marriott across the street to send emails. No issues there. I thought it was a fluke. Nope. Apparently, that's normal as nothing improved despite both myself and a colleague reporting the same issue. She was told to go work in the business center.

Its location, in the center of the Union Square area, provided easy access to San Francisco--there's lots of shopping nearby and good access to public transportation. My partner's conference was at the Moscone Center, and the hotel was within walking distance of that venue (though not the closest property). The style of the hotel was in-keeping with Hyatt--clean and modern. We were in a lovely corner room with a spacious bathroom and great views of the city. The room had plenty of plugs in convenient locations. The lighting was good. The hotel provided the most complete set of toiletries I've ever seen--we even had after-sun lotion and face wash! They were a high quality brand, and I appreciated the extra touches. I am a Hyatt 'Globalist' and we were thus provided access to the Grand Club. The morning continental offering was lovely--lots of healthy options and a beautiful set-up. While the lounge was busy, it appeared right-sized; I never struggled to find a table. The evening offering in the lounge was more standard--a few light appetizers. No complaints, but nothing remarkable. I've seen better evening offerings and I've seen worse. The staff at the hotel was approachable and helpful in all instances. We arrived very early and a room wasn't yet ready. The hotel sent us a text message when it was ready, which was a nice touch. Front desk staff, bell staff, and housekeeping staff were all very welcoming. The hotel's fitness center, on the top floor, has great views! It's small, but had nice equipment and, for its size, a good selection of cardio equipment and weights. Certainly nice to not be trapped in a basement while you use the treadmill, etc. The major issue with the hotel was noise. I am not typically sensitive to noise, nor I am a particularly light sleeper. The noise at this property very negatively affected my stay and my quality of sleep. In this regard, two complaints: first, the doors of the guest rooms SLAM shut. Throughout the night, whenever someone entered or exited a room, you could hear everything...slam, slam, slam. Second, the walls are paper-thin: we could hear every conversation had by our neighbors (which, of course, means they could hear every conversation of ours), and when they returned after a late night out, there was no insulation from their rather noisy recantation of that night out (and, while I wish they had been quieter, they were not being especially disrespectful or loud--the walls are just paper thin). Similarly, in the morning, you could hear the activities of housekeepers in the hallways--talking, going in and out of rooms (tap, tap, tap...door slam), etc. For a hotel of this quality and price point (several hundred dollars a night), being constantly awaken or distributed by noise was very, very disappointing. While the style of the accommodation and helpfulness of the staff would not drive me away completely, I would have difficulty returning to this or recommending this hotel due to the noise issues.",

Yes, this is San Francisco, one of the most expensive cities to live in or visit in the country, so any visitor should expect to pay more than they would almost anywhere else in the U.S. So, do I feel like I got the same 'value' as I would in a similar hotel in a less expensive city? Yes, absolutely. Check-in was a pleasant experience, and we ended up with a great room on a higher floor with a wonderful view of Union Square. We didn't experience a lot of noise from guests next to us or above us - it happened a few times, but it was nothing major. We did also hear the 'creaks' that some others have mentioned as part of the way the building was constructed, but again, it certainly didn't keep us up at night. The room was significantly larger than many other rooms in SF, particularly since we had double beds. Beds were extremely comfortable. Housekeeping was good, but I will admit, not perfect. We had to request toilet tissue one evening, which was delivered fairly promptly. However, that happened two more times during our stay. The housekeeping staff were courteous and friendly, always greeting us in the hallways. Doormen were extremely pleasant and I think I only opened 2-3 doors my entire stay. Concierge staff went out of their way to assist and provide maps and offer personal recommendations. The only time that the service was merely 'serviceable' was at check-out - that transaction was perfunctory at best. We did not use the hotel restaurant, but did use the caf√© near the Concierge area for breakfast one morning, which was very convenient for the day we needed quick coffee and breakfast sandwiches to fuel up for our day trip to wine country. Other than the small housekeeping issues, the only other issue I would note is that the elevators could be a little slow, but I've certainly experienced worse. Also, I'd have liked another drawer or two for our belongings, but that could just be that we overpacked! The hotel is in a fantastic location, and it was an easy walk to everything in Union Square, or over to Chinatown and down to the border of SoMa. Uber/Lyft options are plentiful. Lots of cafes, restaurants and bars within a 2-3 block radius. Cable car access within a block and other transit a 5-minute walk to Market Street. All in all, the hotel met or exceeded our expectations, and although I normally seek out smaller, boutique hotels, I wouldn't hesitate to stay here again.",

I would like to inform you that my family had a blast staying at your hotel. We really liked the design and the atmosphere in the hotel especially the location- near to everything. Our stay will not be completed without your respectful, courteous staff that we had encountered especially the greeter (outside the hotel). They always greet us with a smile even how cold it was outside. We really appreciate for making our stay so memorable. But on 05.23.2017 (8:49 pm ‚Äì TEXAS time/ 6:49 pm- CA time), I called the hotel (Front Desk) to asked her about the package/gift that my friend left me in the Front Desk on Saturday. I asked her if she can check it, but she did transfer me to the lost and found. That item is not considered lost and found, I even have a ticket # in reference to it. So, I called again and asked to be transfer to Front Desk. I spoke to her or maybe another Front Desk Associate (not sure if the same girl or another one), asked to her to checked my package again and provided the reference #. She asked me, if what‚Äôs inside the bag and I told her, I do not know since my friend, didn‚Äôt say any detail about it. Then she told, the items like chips and heavy fish stuff (I am not sure), then I asked if she can send it to my place, since I am back in TX. Then she told, just stop by and pick it up, but I told her, I am back in TX. So, I asked her again, can you please send it to my place and I will pay for it, and then she answered, ‚ÄúIT WILL COST YOU A LOT OF MONEY BECAUSE IT IS HEAVY,‚Äù and then, I answered her, it doesn‚Äôt really matter. With her statement, I felt so belittle and disrespected by her, why because I am have an accent or I am asking too much? Or maybe she‚Äôs just being racist. In the first place, I am not asking the hotel to pay for it and I told her I will pay it. She doesn‚Äôt have the right to tell me those words because it is my money, in the first place and because those are gifts, which means those are important to me. I stayed to your hotel because my friend‚Äôs reception (wedding) will be there. And I thought staying in a luxury and expensive hotel, will provide me a quality customer service but it‚Äôs not. After the front desk, I called concierge and I spoke to Joy (not sure her name), since the front desk told me she will be coordinating with Concierge but the concierge, just transferred me without telling me, which department she will be transferring me and another with attitude. Just a courtesy, the guest should be informed to which department she/he will be transferred. These employees should know how to act properly because their representing your brand, which is Grand Hyatt. But I guess, they don‚Äôt care because even their supervisor, Mr. Flores, acts the same with them. Maybe that‚Äôs why your staff acts like that because they can see it from their supervisor. I deserve a respect it doesn‚Äôt matter is I am paying guest or non-paying guest. I don‚Äôt deserve to be belittled by somebody. You hotel is nice and I bet you have great employees but these 3 rude employees can rotten the good ones and poison their minds. I just hope that these employees will be thankful because they‚Äôre working in a good company and I hope they will return that favor to the company and especially with the+ir guests and colleagues. By the way, even concierge (Joy, I think), she‚Äôs rude to the security employee too that‚Äôs why he called the Shift Front Desk Manger (Andrea) to inform her about the incident. I was so glad that the security associate reached out to Andrea and informed her about the situation. Andrea helped me and Robert from purchasing provided me the tracking information about the package. As a courtesy, Andrea took good care of the shipping but still those employees must learn their lesson. Thank you. Best Regards, MK",

Do not exit the Bart at this stop. Go one further to Montgomery Station. The Powell Station stop is full of homeless people, is filthy, and reeks of urine. Montgomery is only three blocks from the hotel and is a much better choice. The hotel was fine, but very expensive. To park a car overnight was $67. You are paying for the location. The beds were comfortable, everything was clean, but there was nothing special about it. If I were to stay in San Fran again, I would choose to stay down at Fisherman's Wharf.",

The rooms have motorized shades and a confusing Lutron programmed lighting switch system, but no money was spent on essentials such as insulation between walls or floors. It is a bad sign when the bathroom amenities include two pairs of 3M earplugs, which we had to use at night, because any sneezing, tv noise, phone calls from adjacent rooms can be heard clearly. Similarly, when anyone adjacent or above or below your room uses the bathroom, the noise from water running or more personal noises can be heard clearly. The decor of the rooms is very modern, but the housekeeping quality is very low. When we tried to put some of our clothes into the credenza, we were greeted by a thick layer of dust on the shelves. Amenities are quite skimpy in the rooms and we had to request shower caps and slippers. There is a very good quality water tap in the ice room on each floor for refilling bottles.",

However, the room makes very odd creaking noises especially when guests in adjacent rooms are walking around. It was extremely annoying when it started around 7 a.m. and kept going for a good hour. It was very hard to try and ignore and get back to sleep. Note to self: no to Room 1408.

The room itself was more than adequate...yes, the carpet and the furniture felt and looked a little tired, but the room and the bathroom were more than adequate. And while the bar was a nice \"end of day\" sanctuary with a nice assortment of local wines (and bonus snack of cheese popcorn), the hotel's location made it easy to explore. There's a Starbucks directly across the street, where folks don't judge if you stop in in your pajamas. And just in case, there's also a CVS across the street. Plus, there's a couple suitable restaurants within a quick walk, and it's just a 20 min walk to the Ferry Building. I also used the gym, which totally met my needs and expectations and wasn't too crowded during the early morning hours. One additional thing that I always enjoy is that there was a water dispenser in the ice area on my floor. I really appreciate that extra kind of touch.

Took pictures and called the duty manager who sent the housekeeping manager, Sidney to check on me. I told Sidney I had some bites and asked if they were the bites of the bed bugs or other bugs in the room . She was so firmed to say that those are definitely not bed bugs bites as she has seen lots of them. I told them I had the similar ones while I was in India and was told by the local doctor that it was bed bugs bites. I then told her that I can't confine the bites on me now as I am not a certified doctor or medical staff. She then relented and mentioned that she too was not certified to determine the bites and will call in the specialist group to check on the room. Hours later, I received a call from her that the team has done a check and they certified that the room is free from bed bugs. Great to know , but how about other bugs like dust mites or etc ? I was questioned if I had spent my time outside to incur the bites ! The bites were fresh red when I woke up in the morning ! Why not question which bugs had invaded Grand Hyatt over the night and intruded to our room. Nevertheless, I had asked them to clean up the room and make sure it's clean and not infested as we changed our room next door. The room we used previously was given to our family who checked in that day . PS : picture below may be obscene to some.",

What a nice and thoughtful touch. -We wanted to check in early because our flight got in early, and they couldn't accommodate that, however offered to call or text immediately once a room was available. We were able to check in just about an hour after we arrived. The room we got was clean, and modern. It really made our weekend away special.

The service was also very good from all interactions I had, particularly front desk staff. Room service standard was good too. The downsides were that the bar lacked any atmosphere. Only played sport on the big TV's with no music. Restaurant was not appealing at all, the little coffee take away place tucked at back corner in foyer is not well advertised at all, wish I'd known it was there 6 days earlier! Room service were just ok, pillows were bad, and the sink in the bathroom is a terrible design, water leaks and it smells. Small things but when you stay for 8 nights it gets annoying. In summary, great for a 4 night stay, maybe not as long as 8 though.",

The sink is a modern basin that is elevated and since I am only 5'1\" I actually had to stand on my toes so that I can wash my face without the water spraying on me. Bed is very comfy as well as the pillows Concierge David Perea was extremely helpful and even gave us his card to help us get in a booked restuarant (it worked)! Hotel is in the heart of Union Square - all of the high end shopping is within walking distance and well as some restaurants. If traveling again to San Fran I would definitely stay here.

On the day that we left I got to the airport and remembered I left a envelope full of Foreign Exchange and cash in the safe. I was too late to go back and called the Hotel once I got to Los Angeles. They told me to call back the next day as the room was not cleaned yet. I called back and they found the money. I was flying back to Australia the next day. Between the Hotel security and the Manager they organised for the cash to be converted into a bank cheque because they couldn't post so much cash overseas. They didn't charge me a cent for the bank cheque or the postage. I had all my money back within 2 weeks. I never got to thank them but that was truly top class service my a Hotel.

We used the car service for pick up at the Airport, Grand Limousine, but I wouldn't use them again. The car was very old and worn.

The hotel team were always friendly and helped whenever we had a query. We couldn't have asked for a better stay! Wow! Thank you so much for being such a fan of Hyatt hotels and resorts and congratulations on your marriage! We are delighted you two had a wonderful experience with us and enjoyed the view from your room. Your compliment on the service provided by our team is much appreciated. We hope to see you again in the future!",

      "user": "Diegodad2",
      "content": "I arrived during a power failure in the city, but a large amount of the staff was in the lobby greeting guests, passing champagne, being generally accommodating and jovial. I was lucky the key system started to work just as I arrived and I was given a key. I rode up the service elevator with an amazing property engineer who was fantastically friendly and apologetic about the problems. All in all, I was no worse for the wear, despite the terrible potential, potential that might have materialized in a hotel inept at handling difficult situations. I'm sorry I can't rate this hotel 5 stars, but the front door staff was generally disappointing. In fact, on the day of my departure, they stood around without offering to help with luggage. As I waited for an ride share service, a taxi drove pulled up and started berating us for taking Uber rather than a cab, but the staff just laughed and let the driver yell at us. I would have expected them to step up, obtain the driver's information, and ensure their guests were not verbally mauled by someone in their front drive---no such luck. They seemed to find it comical. Since I walked my dog daily, I noticed the difference between the Hyatt's door staff and the other hotels. At each hotel (except the Hyatt), the staff was friendly and generally chatted with me, often coming to greet the dog. At my own hotel, however, I got none of that treatment and, many times, was left to open the door by myself with a dog leash in one hand and packages or coffee in the other. Truly the door staff was noticeably worse than the other hotels in the area. Housekeeping was good and accommodating to my pet in the room, but not always responsive when one called. Room service food was mediocre, and service staff at the 'coffee cart' seemed a bit lost. Concierge was excellent, as was the gentleman who checked us out. The hotel has an amazing location, probably it's strongest asset. Sadly, if the atmosphere I experienced during the power failure had been consistent throughout the stay, this hotel would have been a home run. Once 'back to normal', the Grand Hyatt was disappointing. There are nicer hotels with much better service in the city. One final note: the friendliest staff I met in the hotel in my 5 day stay was the engineering staff. They greeted me each time they saw me, chatted in the elevator, and took a genuine interest in my stay. I wish I could remember the name of the engineer working the elevator on the first day--he was fantastic as well. Thank you for your review. We appreciate your loyalty to Hyatt and your honest feedback. We are sorry to hear we did not meet your expectation during your recent stay. We will be sending you a private message to learn more about your recent experience. We look forward to understanding your experience to make positive adjustments for you and others in the future.",

She hooked us up with a couple vouchers for the lounge along with an upgrade from a queen to a king and wished me a happy birthday, which was a great touch. She made our check in process go as quickly as possible and we were on our way to our room. The room was cute and served its purpose. There's a towel warmer rack, which was cool to see. In the lounge, we had end of night cocktails and snacks (decent menu for the small size of the lounge). We also did breakfast in the lounge which offered the basics (bacon, eggs, cereal, fruit, bread, pastries and yogurt). Great service all over the property and a great location. Would stay here again!

Upon arrival, we were given a room that wasn't even ready. The second room they sent us to (with a mediocre apology for the goof, so far, not a big deal) was very nice. Having been up all night traveling, we settled in for a nap. The construction in the hotel was directly under our 1st floor room. Banging on metal, hoses, banging. Pretty much like a major construction zone. So loud not only could we not nap, but couldn't have a conversation. Called the front desk, who said, \"Yes, there's construction until 4pm.\" No sorry, no offer to move us, just a confirmation that it is really loud and disruptive. WTF? The work began at 8am promptly the next morning, and I had a foot massage with my shower from the jackhammer or whatever underneath me. The first floor rooms should never have been sold under those circumstances, no matter the discount. It was miserable. As we checked out, we said that, and the front desk guy said, \"Oh? Those rooms are on the outside of the building and designated as quiet rooms.\" WTF? Terrible customer service. So even if the remodel is nice, the lack of care from staff will prompt me to tell anyone who asked it's not a good place to stay. As we arrived, the remodel signs tag line was \"you're gonna love it\"-- foreshadowing the \"you'll love it when it's done, right now it's crap\". Hello Ann, Thank you for taking the time to share this unfortunate experience with us. I am very sorry to hear you were inconvenienced by the upgrades taking place. I apologize your first room was not ready and will address this with my team. As for the 2nd room I am pleased you found it great and we were able to get you in early however there was some noise till 4pm. This is our normal check in time so this is why we make sure construction is completed at 4pm when guests are arriving. I am also surprised by the service you received since we are known for our friendly hospitality. I would love to get some more specifics on who assisted you, to help us improve in the future. If you do not mind emailing me directly at aroumph@stanfordcourt.com. We wish your stay would have been more enjoyable and hope to have the opportunity to impress you on a future visit.

Since my wife came to visit, I took a chance and booked based upon reviews, and found that better hotels can be found at lower prices. BTW, this location, which is adjacent to the Fairmont, is hard to beat in my opinion. The only downside is the noise from the cable cars early morning and late into the night, as well as drunk and noisy people going to and from the various hotels in the area. Not a terrible class of drunks, but noisy nevertheless. The trick to avoiding this, I discovered after the fact, is to not get the room with the city view, and ask for the rooms that face courtyard-ish area (but it's not a courtyard, just roof) the inside of the hotel. So a view with noise, or no view and quiet (and a bit lower price). That's the trade off. Hello there, Thank you for taking the time to share your recent visit with us! We are pleased to hear you had a wonderful stay and loved our central location! Yes it is true that the interior rooms tend to be more quiet then the view rooms facing the street.

We recommend our guests take advantage of the great public transit options the city has to offer as much as possible. We value your comments and hope to impress you on a future stay.

The hotel is walking distance to great local attractions in San Francisco. The only issue we encountered is that they were currently renovating at the time of our stay and didn't have any room service or lunch options. Breakfast option was very expensive for a limited buffet. Regardless, San Francisco is such a foodie city that I'd recommend to eat out as much as possible anyways during your visit so this wasn't a big issue for me. Hello Valeria, Thank you for the kind comments about our friendly hotel staff and your recent stay at our Hotel. We are pleased you found our location to be amazing and enjoyed all the great eateries SF has to offer. We agree there are so many great options to choose from in the city that are hard to compete with. We do apologize for the inconvenience in our upgrades taking place, but appreciate you understanding. We hope to welcome you back once our reboot is finished. Thank you again, Best, Michael Baier",

We were well looked after even before we arrived with Michael and Geoff offering advice, booking restaurants and advising about activities on e mail prior to arrival. They are currently going through a 'reboot' as they call it, shame as you couldn't get to see the hotel in all its glory whilst the lobby area is done but had no effect on our enjoyment or comfort. Breakfast relocated to 6th floor during the update. Great selection of cooked breakfast or continental. Rooms comfortable and still looking good despite being ready to be re done. Perhaps the only thing to criticise would be the bed toppers that do move about but guess new beds are probably part of the Reboot. We were celebrating a special birthday for my husband and they even left a gift and birthday card for him for our arrival! Nice touch. Great central location served by the cable cars although walking fairly easy (just take your time on the steep hills) Fitbit said I climbed 98 floors one day!! and cabs pretty reasonable.

      "content": "I first stayed here over 50 years ago as a child and it was my first experience in a fine hotel. I stayed here many times. I held a c since but I will never return. First, the hotel is under construction, which they did not disclose. So no lobby, no restaurant, and breakfast consisted of coffee (no decaf!) and hot water. Apparently there was juice somewhere but I never found it. The new owners apparently plan to turn this into a hip boutique. They have a lot to learn about hotel service. The problems began at check in. Although there is no lobby, much less a resort, they tried to charge a $20 resort fee! This is a new trick I've seen in a lot of San Francisco hotels, and it's a joke. I said no and the rather rude desk clerk reluctantly removed the charge. But they she added a $50 A DAY incidentals fee to the reserve on my credit card. ($250 for my visit) Since there was no restaurant or shop or spa, I wondered what they thought I could spend $250 on! And the minibar in my room was empty and smelled bad. Speaking of smells, my room smelled like grandma's basement, with a hint of grandpa's cigar. Clearly the rooms haven't be remodeled and it's not in the plans. The bathroom has an automatic light that goes on when you walk in and NEVER GOES OUT. So not fun in the middle of the night. After one night, I checked out and the manager agreed to release my $250 \"incidental\" charges. Never again. Hi there, Thank you for taking the time to share your thoughts with us, I apologize that the hotel is not the same one you once remembered, I understand our hotel is not to everyone‚Äôs taste but I personally think blandness is boring ‚Äì our current #REBOOT is a full head to toe update from the our lobby to our guestrooms filled with thoughtful additions along with green and tech touches. Our renovation is listed on both our website and mentioned numerous times in our responses to reviews here on TripAdvisor. We should have done a better job pointing out the coffee and juice, we have two separate locations one in our lobby and the other in our 6th floor restaurant (which serves breakfast, drinks and dinner) which includes decaf and juice with awesome views of the city. Our incidental fee is always returned at the end of our guests stay if unused ‚Äì it allows for charges to the room in the restaurant and purchasing movies as well. The team here @TSC and myself are all very excited about our upcoming brand new product and can‚Äôt wait to share it with our guest‚Äôs, I hope you give us the opportunity to welcome you back in the near future.

Other than the obvious sentimental reasons the hotel also provides a great location in Nob Hill. Both of the Powell lines and the California line cable cars run beside the hotel. It's an easy walk to Union Square and the financial district. After we flew in we took BART from SFO to the Embarcadero station. From there the hotel is right up California street. To save money I decided we should just walk up the hill with our bags to the hotel. This was not a good decision. Unless you are into fitness challenges or are just sadistic I would highly recommend not doing that. When we left we took uber to SFO (~$30) which was very easy and a considerably better decision. The hotel is undergoing a renovation but it didn't really affect us that much. Before I booked our room I signed up for their email list and when I got an offer for 25% off and 2 free breakfast coupons I jumped on it. The room was fine and had everything we needed. The breakfast was good if unspectacular. We enjoyed our stay at Stanford Court San Francisco and would consider staying here again in the future. Hello there, Happy Anniversary and thank you for choosing our hotel to spend it! Your loyalty means a lot to us. We apologize you found out the hard way about the incline up to our hotel from Embarcadero, this would be a bit tough with loads of luggage.

Having been to San Fran a number of times, I know what to expect from these older buildings. You can't expect huge rooms such as bathrooms either. The walls were thin but that is pretty standard. People are rating this hotel low for all the homeless people but it's not the hotel's fault. San Fran has a shortage on housing not to mention the skyrocketed prices to live there. Can you fault the homeless? Once a place that they could afford, blew up over the last few years and the city is trying to cover up their problems by methods that by the looks of it unsuccessful. As a tourist, I want to see the city but seeing the city means seeing it for what it is. San Fran is know for their homeless community. You can't have the hotel try to cover it up and dust it under the rugs as what the city has been trying to do. I can go on and on. But the main point is don't lower your ratings for the hotel because of the homeless. You can go down a few blocks and see the same thing in front of the Westin (thats right in front of Union Square) or the other high end places. I mean they camp out in front of Saks and Burberry.",

Located close to Union Square, there's lots of public transit around, and lots of places to eat at. The hotel it self is fairly small, as other reviewers have stated...the elevator only holds about four people and is very slow. The rooms and bathroom are a little smaller than a typical hotel but served its purpose and we didn't spent much time in the room anyways. Room was always clean and the beds were comfy. Only complaint was that theres no air conditioning so the room did get quite warm and stuffy. Overall, a positive experience and the price was right.",

Ohmygosh so good!!!! The room was cozy and clean. Modern, minimalist but with a classic hotel feel. Staff was super accommodating. The first morning we were there, we asked them to check on the sink that was draining slowly. Within half an hour (we had to go back for a jacket!) not only was the sink fixed but the room was already made up! Joseph welcomed us first night and recommended several restaurants for us. Every time we asked for extra coffee instead of tea in the room, they happily obliged. Only complaint was that there were some extra charges that a certificate we got was supposed to cover.

In any average USA city this hotel would be considered a 2 star hotel. I have not stayed in any other hotel in San Francisco downtown to really compare, so maybe by San Francisco standard it is a 4 star? I have stayed in the area like Oakland, Napa and San Jose. Most of those other area those are considered a 3 star hotel. They all have a desk, dresser and chair. They all have wall art, air conditioning and twice the room space. The Tilden has none of this. The Tilden rooms are small. There is no parking or free breakfast, expect to pay $40 to park a car in a near by garage per night or even more for valet parking. When exiting the front door, don't turn right, the homeless are relentless there. Turing left is the better side of town, but my wife was scared driving to the place as we saw allot of homeless on the streets. For the money, it is not bad and if you are willing to comprise the lack of amenities for the location, then it is an okay choice in a relatively okay location. The rooms are clean enough, but it is just the bare essentials at the Tilden. The place is in between a Motel 8 and a low end Comfort Inn.",

I've stayed many times in San Francisco and was familiar the hotel's location in Union Square/The Tenderloin and when I booked The Tilden based on it's reasonable price my expectations were limited. I was surprised then to be welcomed by a spacious and comfortable lobby and even better a friendly and helpful staff. I had requested a quiet room in my booking form and they assigned me a room in the back of the hotel on a mid-level floor. The hotel is old and the room was small however tastefully and comfortably appointed. There was some street noise during business hours, however after 10 PM is was quiet which is reasonable. The bathrooms are real small and if that bothers you don't stay here, I was fine though. The attached bar is well-tended and the coffee shop is good. The rooms are small enough that they are not practical for work, however the lobby is designed to accommodate multiple workers with laptops and phones.

Didn't realize that the rooms did not come with any air conditioning --not that it was needed in SF but the option to have it would be great. We came back to a very stuffy room for 3 nights =/ We had a room with a balcony which was great, added more character to the room. However on day 2, the window broke and it just became an inconvenience to open up the window. The staff offered to move us to a different room but it wouldn't have the views so we just dropped it. Locked the windows and propped it open with whatever we had when it became too stuffy. This hotel is comfortable ---you can definitely tell the old from the renovated. I would have loved drawers to put my stuff in instead of the open closet but again I think all that comes with the aesthetic of the hotel. I think if you like modern, minimalist, with a mix of industrial this is the hotel for you. The Douglas Room received great reviews and was recommended by other hotel lounges/bar staff. We ordered from their late night menu and that philly cheese was the bomb. Overall our stay was pleasant. The staff was very accommodating and nice. As a boutique hotel I think its off to a great start. Amazing amenities, decor, Thank you for such a splendid review about our services and the restaurant! We are so sorry about the window as it seems to have dampened your overall stay. Please let us know your room number so we can fix it immediately.

FYI- Always turn left once you exit the front doors. Close to shops and diners. Also close (4 blocks) to the Powell St Station which you will need if you BART to and fro the airport. Facility: Stayed on 8th floor, corner room, which faced Taylor St. Loud but c'mon you guys we're in the city!! Thin walls. The room next to us was being crazy loud and I could hear their entire late night drunk conversation. The bathroom was really cute. Tall, stand alone sink, black tiled floor, good water pressure. Malin & Goetz soap and lotion which was great. No toothpaste in the room. The towels were plush. The bed and pillow were king-sized and very comfortable. Room had an Ihome radio/speaker. No AC but the temp never got above 70. Big TV but we did not use a lot. Small fridge in the room which kept the vodka cold. The ceiling fan had two settings- fast and super fast. Quality iron in the closet. No dresser in the room. Overall, it was a cute room for the price. Elevator was small and ran slow, but who's in a huge rush on vacation? Just relax. Pretty \"hummingbird garden\" in the back. Coffee from the cafe was good. Staff: Door guy (tall with dreads So sorry I forgot his name) was great and made us feel super safe. Cat was amazing and made our requests possible. Joeseph was also so so helpful and accommodating. I forgot the name of the guy who checked us in. He was Indian, thin, had black hair. He was pretty standoffish and a smidge rude at check in. The other people were great. I made it a point to only ask Cat and Joseph questions as to not interact with the Indian gentleman.

The roof was large and clean and although there was a limited view from the window it was to be expected for a city centre location. The hotel is walking distance to union square and the main shopping area and we even walked to Pier 39 which isn't a struggle for a young active couple. The hotel is located close to a bar / restaurant called Jasper's which had a great atmosphere! The bathroom in the room was fantastic with a brilliant selection of toiletries. Thank you so much for your kind appreciation of our hotel and its services. We hope you enjoyed every moment in San Francisco and would love to welcome you again at the Tilden Hotel.",

      "content": "05/26/2017 This hotel is located in an horrible neighborhood surrounded by homeless and trash all over. The Hotel has only one old elevator that's always busy and very slow. You'll find yourself going up and down on the stairs most of the time. They have very few housekeepers. They weren't able to clean up my room at 3PM. They are understaffed, with practically no service. Many times I got back to my room and towels from the bathroom where exactly as I left them. Once I found a pillow on the floor without pillowcase. Windows are old and get stuck and on the other end they don't close properly. One night the heating system went on and the radiator started making an horrible noise because it was overeating. At 3:30AM I had the plumber coming up and fixing the problem. For sure I won't come back here, and I strongly advise you to look somewhere else. We are sorry to hear about your experience. We do understand that at times, even with our best effort, things can go wrong and the smallest of inconsistencies can turn the experience around. We will address your issues with each department and ensure that none of what you experienced, is repeated. Thank you, Kunal Khandwala Front Office Manager",

The room was a good size and tastefully appointed the bathroom was small but not uncomfortable everything was very clean. The lobby was obviously recently redone and makes a good impression. There is a bar restaurant and coffee shop in the building, both are quite good. We had coffee before we left, it was very good and convenient. When we got back from the theater around 11:30 we were able to go to the bar have a late night snack (delicious philly cheese steak and tots) and a cocktail before going to our rooms. The service we received from everyone during our stay was above par. A couple of things to be aware of, there are homeless people in the area and a few were camped out on Taylor Street when we returned from the theater but I never felt like I needed to be worried about it. There isn't any air-conditioning (there is a ceiling fan) in the rooms but it rarely gets warm enough in San Francisco to worry about it. Greetings Julie, We truly appreciate your detailed feedback about our services, the restaurant, bar and cafe. We hope you enjoyed Hamilton and will return to the city for many more events!

The room did not have AC and the windows were almost impossible to open to let fresh air in. The bar downstairs had a nice staff with good drinks. The area around the hotel, when making a left out the front door, was nice and took you to Union Square. However, when taking a right out of the hotel the streets were full of homeless and the area became not welcoming for tourists.

Since I already left a kidney with delta to fly there, booked a deal at Tilden through priceline. At first I was very skeptical... Some reviews were mediocre, and I usually go to big chain hotels. As it was affordable, I figured should give it a try. Upon arrival, was greeted by Kat. She is by far the best front desk rep I have ever met. She gave me a room that fit my specific needs, recommended restaurants and supplied me with tips that made my visit so much better. The room was very clean, surprisingly large, and I was shocked to find Malin and Goetz products in the bathroom! People complaining about it being a dispenser- are you kidding me? I finally can use enough products for my long hair without having to call and ask for extra tiny tubes! Score!! And when I did call for extra towels- they were at my door before a minute passed. Every day my room was cleaned spotless and smelled nice. The doorman and front desk greeted me with every single time I left or came back. The entire team was so nice and thoughtful, and I really felt like they care about me having a great stay. And it was! Will sure come back here next time I'm in SF. Thank you Kat and the rest of the team! It was a pleasure :) Greetings Sandra, Thank you for such a fantastic review of your stay at Tilden Hotel!

      "title": "Hear all the sounds from the street, even from top floors",
      "user": "Carolina M",
      "content": "This hotel is OK. It's has its pros and cons. Starting with the pros: the staff is fantastic, very helpful and genuine, they seem to really enjoy working here which is always refreshing to encounter. The rooms are spacious and clean, with all the amenities and a mini fridge. No air conditioning though. The area is also very central, close to Union Square and all the shops and restaurants within walking distance. But be careful if you walk down Taylor street into the Tenderloin area. Now the cons: The bathroom is small, the sink is a tiny half sink like those ones you would find in lavatories. There's a shelf placed right above the tiny sink making it impossible to wash your face and it's even difficult to brush your teeth without spilling water everywhere. (Ladies wearing makeup, better just have a shower) It's also very noisy. I'm on the 6th floor and I can hear everything, and it's a very busy street, so prepare to hear trucks, sirens, people shouting, loud music from the cars'radios. I suspect if a pin drops on the floor downstairs, I can hear from up here. As if it was inside the room. So pack your ear plugs because Americans like their car horns. Third con was the room temperature. It was baking hot. It's around 10-13 degrees Celsius outside but on my first night the heating was on at maximum and I couldn't turn it off. Second night they turned it off for me but it was still very hot. There is no air con, so I cannot imagine spending a night here in summer. The windows don't open and there's a ceiling fan that only works on the minimum speed. Last con, but that's a minor one: there's no breakfast. If you want breakfast, you need to head to the cafe next door or to one of the many options around the area. All in all, not a terrible hotel but I think I could have found something slightly better for the money. Greetings Carolina, Thank you for sharing such a detailed feedback including your experience with our agents and their genuine service. I do understand the concerns you have brought up and while some of those issues are a part of our current plan to improve, others pertain more to the hotel's characteristics and our centralized location in the busy area of downtown. We do take your feedback seriously and will take every opportunity to improve. Thank you Kunal Khandwala Front Office Manager",

Yes, the room and bathroom was small and you could hear people and cars outside the street but that's pretty normal for most hotels in touristy downtown locations. The lower cost and location was the main reason why we booked. For me and my husband, it was worth the savings since we were only going to stay for one night and then drive to Sonoma/Napa for a few nights thereafter. Tip: There are multiple car rental agencies across the street from the hotel. We saved money by taking uber from the SFO airport to the hotel and then rented a car for the days that we would be driving outside the city. We were also able to drop the car off at the end of our trip at a different location in the Oakland airport area too. Parking your car at the hotel will cost around $50 extra per night.

He knew it was walking distance to Union Square, Fisherman's Wharf and Chinatown. George, at the front desk, was very helpful over the phone, as well as when we arrived on Monday night. We booked 2 rooms. 4 adults and 4 teens. We stayed 2 nights. The doorman (?) Jonathan, directed us to the hotel restaurant for dinner, but when we asked for other options he help us out and also directed us to some nightlife, both in the hotel, and out. He maneuvered the cart with our luggage into the tiny elevator like a pro. We parked our car across the street, for about $32 per day. The rooms are small, but not overly so. Although there is no air conditioner, the ceiling fan and open window kept us cool. We did not need to use the radiator. I enjoyed the compostable containers of complimentary coffee for the Keurig. Although the walls are thin, it wasn't a problem for us. We were in the corner (room 310) and met the nice couple in the room next to us, while we were extending our stay for the second night. They said we didn't keep them up, and they didn't keep us up. The bathroom was very small in our room, but our friends were staying in room 307 and their bathroom was more spacious, so maybe it was because we had a corner room, and the layout was different. Biggest negative of the room was the double shelf over the sink, that prevented me from washing my face, without getting the floor very wet. Once again, our friends had a different room layout, including different placement of the shelves, so it's obviously not an issue in all the rooms. The shower had the best water pressure I've ever experienced in a hotel. The complimentary shampoo, conditioner and body wash were unique. In the morning, Kat, at the front desk was fun to talk to, and get pointers about the city and the hotel hummingbird garden, as well as a burger place I had never heard of before. The second day when we were heading out to breakfast it was raining, and we were given hotel umbrellas to use for our walk. Very nice and accommodating staff. A clean and convenient hotel.

The room was very beautiful with minimal clutter. Flat screen tv and white linen. Ask for extra towels if you are not rooming alone. The elevator is slow, But the hotel itself is beautiful and eclectic. The lobby music is fun. Switched from 90's r&b to 80's rock and current hip hop. I like the feel of this place. It's not too fancy but offers upscale service. Greetings! We are thrilled to have Kat join our team at the Tilden and your acknowledgement of our upscale service is what we strive to achieve.

      "content": "I booked the Tilden Hotel via Priceline and the name your own price feature. I wanted an upscale hotel near Union Square and I feel I got my money‚Äôs worth. The Tilden is small boutique style hotel about two blocks from Union Square. It is an old building that has been refurbished and nicely appointed. The lobby is funky chic and it has both a coffee shop and a bar/restaurant attached. I tried both and was very pleased in both cases. The restaurant/bar mixed up some amazing craft cocktails and great apps. I have used Priceline in the past and at some hotels been given a bad room as if to punish me for bargain hunting. Not the case with the Tilden, they gave me a king room without issue and never once gave me the ‚Äúoh, you booked through Priceline so we can‚Äôt help you with that‚Äù attitude. They were happy to have me as a guest and treated me as such. OK, things to know. This is an old building as are many of the boutique hotels in San Francisco. That said, this building has no air conditioning. However, this is San Francisco and not Los Angeles, the temps do not get very high in the city. Each room has a powerful overhead fan, which kept the sleeping area nice and comfortable. Yes, the room was a bit stuffy, but not uncomfortable. The windows open to allow a breeze and if I had one complaint, it is that they do not open enough. There is a limiter on the windows for safety sake. Perhaps if the could put decorative gratings on the outside of the window, they could be opened all the way allowing the cool San Francisco air to chill the room. That is the only change I would suggest. The bed was outstanding. A bit firm, but VERY comfortable. Best were the pillows, large but very soft and that was perfect for me. In fact, I compare them with the best pillows I‚Äôve experienced top hotels. Linens were crisp and clean. The room has a nice large screen TV, a minifridge and a safe. There is adequate closet space. The bathroom is small, but functional. Water came out strong and hot and the toilet is powerful. Towels were soft and plentiful and the room staff were great. The hotel staff was the best part of the stay. Everyone was courteous. Desk staff were informative and the they even have a helpful doorman and security officer. Yes, a security officer ‚Äì this is downtown San Francisco and if you are not ready to see an abnormal amount of homeless, some of whom see mentally ill, then do not come to San Francisco. Everywhere you go in downtown San Francisco, you will se security. Even stores, so seeing security in your hotel is just the norm and your assurance that your stay will be safe and peaceful. The hotel is on a nice street, but the one thing you need to remember when you walk out the door. TURN LEFT. Never turn right. Heading to your right will take you into a very sad and desperate neighborhood, taking a left will take you to Union Square, lots of great food and other hotels. Turning right will take you down the hill to an area that is transitioning to something better, but for now is not comfortable for visitors. Please do not be put off by other reviews claiming this hotel is in the ghetto. It is not. As I mentioned before, you have to be ready for San Francisco before coming here. Like New York City, you will see opulence and sadness in the same glance. The Tilden was a great value; it was located next door to the Hilton so that should give you an idea of the neighborhood. Considering that we paid far less then we would have at the Hilton and enjoyed a very personable experience, this was the place to stay. Greetings! At the Tilden, each guest is special to us and we do not treat the ones who booked through different channels unfairly. But I do agree with you that some hotels discriminate take away from consistent hospitality. I thank you for your detailed review and sharing your candid opinions about our neighborhood, amenities and service. We surely hope that other guests see the positives and experience the Tilden Hotel. Please reach out to us in the future when planning a visit to San Francisco as we'd love to host you again.

We were always greeted with friendly smiles and chatter including front desk staff, doormen, cleaning staff, bartenders and especially the coffee shop staff in the lobby. The location was fairly close to Powell station, so we could take the BART train from SFO to the hotel without issue. There were just a number of minor misses that made the stay not as enjoyable: - The bathroom door wasn't able to fully shut. When sharing a room with a friend this isn't the most ideal situation. - After cleaning our room, they would be fairly stingy in replenishing the toilet paper. - They were also stingy on replacing the same number of face towels, hand towels and bath towels. With every passing day it seemed we were getting fewer towels. - The pump for the hair conditioner wasn't working, so it only spat out liquid which left my hair in knots. - Both the safe and bathroom door hooks were placed much much higher than regular hotels, which was odd and inconvenient. - The elevator was small and incredibly slow, but that's understandable in an older boutique hotel.

Pros: 1- very friendly staff 2- clean rooms 3- New furniture in the rooms but no drawers Cons: 1- Only 1 small elevator. I opted for taking the stairs 2- No air conditioning. I later found out that many hotels in San Francisco do not have air conditioning in the rooms because the air is always cool. However, my room was always hot and the ceiling fan was not enough 3- Small bathroom - only one person fit in the bathroom. If you are traveling with kids, this is not a hotel for you. 4- No drawers whatsoever in the room. We had to spread out our suitcases in the room. There is a small closet with a few hangers, that's it. 5- Location. Like I said above, the hotel is near a homeless shelter. Lot's of homeless people nearby, most of them were high on drugs. They were not shy on dealing and using drugs in front of the passerby. 6- My room did not look anything like the picture in the hotel webpage.

Our room on the 8th got a bit warm in the evenings and held that heat for a while but quite manageable as the weather was mild while we were there. The bar and grill was great. Very competent bar tenders and the food was really tasty. Overall a great experience. Proximity to the active night life in the area was good too. Thanks for sharing your experience with your review of the Tilden. You are absolutely right about the lower floor rooms being cooler on the occasional hot day the city experiences.

The staff is outstanding, with a balanced professionalism and warmth that is tough to find in larger commercial hospitality organizations. The rooms are comfortably appointed, with nice upgraded touches to help balance with the age of the building. While the rooms do not have air conditioning, they do include ceiling fans to move the air, the white noise of which helps to block out city noise if, like me, you sleep with the windows open. My stay was pleasant, improved by the friendliness of the staff who always made themselves available to assist me if needed. It was a pleasure to return to the hotel every day knowing if there was ever an issue it would be taken care of with a smile. Thankfully, I never had to find out as my stay was problem free. Aside from the lack of A/C, the only other issue that may impact visitors is the single, small elevator. On a busy night, it may take a while to catch a ride up or down. It was only an issue for me once, and without luggage the stairs were a fine solution. Greetings!

I'm a nursing mom and was able to arrange early check-in so I could go to my room and pump immediately upon arriving. And since my room had a fridge but no freezer, they also offered to store my ice packs in the employee freezer before my journey home. The front desk even reminded me to put them in the freezer the night before :). I also had an Amazon Now delivery sent to the hotel and they were very courteous about accepting it and bringing it to my room for me. A huge thank you to the staff! Be aware that Ellis street, just south of the hotel, gets pretty rough at night. Better to walk up to Geary or O'Farrell en route to the hotel. Also, the rooms are more run-down than the photos would suggest. They have slapped a new coat of paint on everything, but the floors are uneven and the walls have dings and chips. Not a big deal to me, as everything in the room was clean, just be aware that although the lobby feels like a 5-star hotel, the rooms do not. Loved the Malin and Goetz toiletries.

      "content": "Stayed 1 week (3/15/17-3/22/17). ROOM LOCATION/SOUND: Room was 4th floor (407) facing down to the exhaust systems for the hotel that are squared in by the building. It was quiet and I could not hear the loud music from the Tilden's bar. However, even after having put \"Do Not Disturb\" on the door and staying for several more days, we got awakened. FRONT DESK: The front desk staff was friendly. Lesa checked us in and could not have been sweeter. She went out of her way to make us welcome. Jimmy courteously assisted us with issues. I don't recall the names of the other gentlemen that greeted us most times that we came and went & who helped with the issues stated later in this review. ISSUES: Unfortunately, every day (including that one - ok, there was ONE I refer to below that I didn't physically go to the front desk for this) I had to go to the front desk to request an additional washcloth. When there are 2 people in the same room, I would think you would be sure there was at least 2 washcloths. This is unacceptable to me. We might be close; but, that is going too far and a terrible policy to only put one in a room. That it happened a couple times...maybe. But every single day with a daily ritual of asking? I even had put notes in the room to no avail in order to avoid having to keep asking. On a positive side, the bed was always made nicely. - Unfortunately, our allergies kicked in with a vengeance. It seemed clear that it was not the room causing it but the fact that we had left winter at home and come to springtime suddenly. However, there was no kleenex in the room at all. I had to go ask for those too. When those ran out, they were not replaced either. It would have been easy to see that we were using them and needed them just by the amount found in the trashcan each day. I finally went to a store and bought our own. I have never been in a motel or hotel that did not at least have those no matter how thin or rough they may have been. - Additionally, because we were not sure what the issue was and we were feeling miserable, we had bought our own drinks including powerade. We had used the glasses in the room and one of the mornings there was dried powerade in the bottoms. The glasses were not replaced either. I put them in the sink, with a note on top asking for \"clean glasses\" and the TWO washcloths. There was indeed a 2nd washcloth that day. However, there were 2 DIRTY glasses left...and they were not the same ones we had! One of the glasses had full fingerprints on the INSIDE of the glass as well as some type of film line and residue as if someone had left milk sit inside it. It was not something you could miss when looking at the glass. Perhaps a true oversight, perhaps a mistake, perhaps retaliation for having pointed out the lack of washcloths so many times or the note requesting clean glasses. It is very sad that I would even speculate why it happened in the first place. Jimmy at the front desk apologized & had someone deliver new glasses. I apologized for being the \"problem guest\" (my feeling) and told him that I never visit a front desk this much during a stay. I checkin and checkout with minimal contact unless it is a place where the front desk is the way to get a wakeup call. He assured me that they are having issues with training staff and this helps them do that & that I had been \"really nice about it\". Yesterday was the last full day here and we were out until 11pm. I wanted to come back and relax and maybe take a shower. Again, ONE washcloth. I was livid that this was still continuing while they could deliver a note under the door stating that the elevator would be down between 10-2 today (making checkout difficult). So, instead of staying in the room, we both decided to go back out to get fast food and voice my dissatisfaction at the front desk again about the washcloths. THE ELEVATOR... very very small. About 4 people can fit in it very close to each other. Any luggage has to be taken into consideration. There were two of us with two stacked bags and that was all we could actually fit in the elevator. Now, this morning, we have to contact the desk to have some type of help...whatever that will be to get our luggage down because there is no way we can take that down 4 flights of stairs. -THE ROOM: There is an individual serving Keurig in the room. However, it was NEVER restocked with coffee or tea or anything we could use. After the 3rd day (I think), we went and asked Jimmy at the front desk if we were able to have any of those or not. It would have been very helpful to have something warm to drink and soothe our throats. He reached into a drawer and gave us a couple teas and a coffee. After that, it was still never replenished by housekeeping besides one day we left a note asking and I gave up pursuing that in lieu of washcloths. (That one day we specifically said what NOT to leave and what we would like. That was not what happened. As I said, I gave up on this issue.) - The room itself is spacious. The walk-in closet is nice although dark. A single LED strip of lights which is motion-activated is on the vertical of the door frame. It would be better if it were centered and above. But, given that there is no other light in the closet, it is good to have. There is no table except the one that the large TV, ice bucket, and Keurig sit on. There is 1 chair in the room despite having more than 1 guest. There was a collapsible luggage rack... which is common for places I have stayed. But, those places have typically had some type of table to sit at with at least a couple chairs in the room. Other reviews have said there is no A/C. That is true, The fan does help. However, it was quite warm at times and the bathroom has no fan. So, we remained damp after showering unfortunately. The tub drain stopper randomly would stop the drain while showering. The shower is quite nice and, while the shower head had a leak that sent water arcing above us a little, it was still a nice waterfall shower head. The soaps are nice with essential oils and mounted behind oneself. It was difficult to have a good angle when pumping them and that would be nice to have different. The bathroom has additional space for a small table or such as well in order to sit a toiletry bag perhaps. There is a small mounted shelf that spans the length of the sink; but, it is only wide enough to sit a can of shaving gel. And, I lean over a sink to wash my face or brush my teeth and the shelf is actually in the way for me at 5'7\" which means more than once I hit my head against it. The lights beside the bed have individual dimmer controls which was a nice convenience to have. The safe in the closet is also very nice. Unfortunately, it is on the high shelf. So, without a chair to stand on, I could not see inside it. There is a light that comes on for a few seconds when you open the door; but, otherwise, it is dark and you cannot see. The bed was very very comfortable. The pillows were square and just enough for my head. I don't need much more than that and liked them. I am sure others might want larger pillows; but, I found them quite comfortable. Given the lack of any other actual tables, the bedside stands on either side of the bed were used a lot. It would have been good if they could have been larger to make up for the lack of an actual table in the room. There is a small refrigerator. We were able to fit about 4 powerades in it and a bottle of wine by taking out 1 shelf and raising the other to the highest we could. It really isn't much larger. A \"to go\" box from dinner had to be angled and smashed to fit with the bottles in the fridge to give you an idea. The full-length mirror inside the bedroom area of the room is very nice as well since the bathroom gets so steamy and could not really provide that mirror space. THE AREA: There is indeed a lot of homeless in the area. A couple times we came out to someone blowing marijuana smoke directly in our faces as we left the hotel. I do not think that was a guest. However, coming back several times there were people from the hotel that stood right at the entrance smoking and we had to excuse ourselves to walk through them to the door. I never felt unsafe at the hotel or even at the corner to the right where the tents were setup or where there were people lining the walls asleep or sitting up. It is just a sad reality that homelessness exists and these affected people have to be part of that. THE CAFE/LOBBY: The Cafe was nice. The iced coffee sample everyday was very good and there were days we saw samples of brownies or quiche or similar on a tray with toothpicks in them. The Cafe staff and the door/bell staff were always pleasant, smiling, and just trying to be great customer-service people. LOCATION: The location was convenient enough to stores, public transport, the convention center, and the cable cars that most people probably want to see/ride at least once. SUMMARY: While I don't expect compensation for the inconveniences I experienced, and the staff were friendly enough, I don't think that I would recommend staying here to anyone given the level of simple services that had to be requested over and over. There would have to be places with housekeeping staff that are more attentive and management that would ensure that especially given the amount of money spent and the length of time we stayed. Dear Tony, We offer our sincere gratitude to you for sharing such detailed feedback. Considering the time and effort on your part, we have had an internal meeting to ensure that the issues you have faced remain the last exception to our own guest service levels. While your appreciation for our team members and attributes of our hotel do certainly encourage us, we take your critique of the issues in a constructive manner and are working on all the practical solutions as well as some of the structural ones. Thank you again for sharing your experience and please feel free to reach out to me when in the city again. We would appreciate the opportunity to replace your previous experience with a new one. Thank you, Kunal Khandwala Front Office Manager",

We were staying on the 9th floor our room was huge and spacious with two seperate rooms - a lounge room with tv and ample closet space, then a huge bedroom and bathroom also with tv. The bed was very comfortable and clean as well as extra luxurious as it was a queen size. Our floor was very quiet and relaxing we loved it. The elevator worked great as well! The lobby is modern and beautiful and we found it perfect and easy that there was both a cute cafe connected as well as a beautiful bar with amazing cocktails. The hotel itself is positioned right in the middle of the city which is very convenient, easy access to the main shopping district but also a perfect launch pad for anywhere else in the city. My boyfriend and I had a lovely stay we will definitely be back! Greetings Lilli, We are so happy to hear that you enjoyed your stay at the Tilden so much! We look forward to welcoming you back.

However there is a garage/parking lot nearby, and I believe the hotel offers valet parking for a fee. Greetings Stephen, You are correct about the parking situation and we highly recommend our guests to either opt for our valet service or one of the parking garages in the area.

Homeless right out the door; be prepared for the aromatic brew of urine and marijuana. ADVICE ... Due to distance from Union Square, stay a little closer to the action in a consensus 4-star hotel.

This is not a real hotel but more like a hostel with a\" fancy \" lobby. A weak , cheap fan placed on the ceiling to circulate the warm air and if you question the front desk regarding your discomfort , you will hear the programmed answer that in San Fran no one uses temperature control. Seriously ? I mind you we stayed there during the spring in cool days. The room small , old and grim , no desk or chair , even a light in a hallway but very , very small with no space. Perhaps the owner used a can of paint over old walls and calls it a new hotel ??? The bathroom you will not be able to turn around ( so small ) with of course no temp control so never plan on using a hairdryer without a heat stroke. Oh .... for $ 656 for 3 nights .... the location is 2 blocks from the homeless shelters . The fun never stops at the \" TILDEN \" !

With that being said, it's a no frills experience. The bar/caf√© is under construction (but not a big deal due to the location) and there's not really any concierge service to speak of. Also, there's no air conditioning (but it's San Francisco, so we didn't need it...still, might be a dealbreaker for hot natured people). All in all, I'd stay there again for the right price.

I paid an obscenely high rate to stay here (over $800/night), but this is basically an airbnb with a nice lobby. The staff have no idea what they're doing. They repeatedly called my room insisting that I was supposed to be checking out early, even though every reservation confirmation I received had the correct check out date, and when I checked in they confirmed the correct check out date. The front desk person casually told me that they consistently mess up reservations that are made through Expedia or travel agents, so I guess I shouldn't have been surprised. It usually took several attempts to get through when calling the front desk. There is no room service. There are no amenities. The Malin + Goetz bath products in the bathroom were empty. In terms of a \"mini bar,\" you get an empty fridge that isn't cold, plus some caramel popcorn, corn chips, and $5 water. The outlets next to the bed didn't work. Even the phones in the room are crappy. They put a \"hold\" of $3,000 on my credit card the day I checked in. They clearly opened this hotel before it was ready, for what is at best a budget hotel, the prices they are charge are simply obscene.

      "user": "Simon M",
      "content": "I was content at the Tilden for a week. I went in not expecting anything special, and it was fine for a budget option. The rooms are actually quite nice (mine anyway, I stayed in a king room) but poorly-lit which really lets them down. The staff were lovely without exception, they made me feel very well looked-after. The lack of breakfast is a big drawback, they should partner with a local cafe until their own cafe is ready. There's a tiny fitness room and garden. The lobby area is recently-refurbished and is nice. The area is not nice. The streets all around the hotel are full of homelessness, which is a problem for the whole area (not especially bad or good around the hotel itself). I didn't have any problems and there is a doorman at the hotel. I didn't notice much noise from outside, though the room walls are pretty thin so I could hear the alarm from next door each morning which was annoying. If you're trying to choose between the large number of budget hotels in central SF, you could do a lot worse than the Tilden - don't be put off! Hello Simon, Thank you for sharing your feedback with us. We evaluate all guest reviews to ascertain the improvements we can make to our existing facilities. We strive to continuously improve our product and service. Room lighting is our big upcoming focus and our cafe, restaurant and bar are opening in a matter of days. Hopefully you can give us another try upon your next visit and enjoy many of these updates. Thank you again, Kunal Khandwala Front Office Manager",

The location is convenient to many restaurants and small shops and the Taylor Street Coffee Shop next door may be small but the food is amazing and well worth the wait if there is a line to get in. I loved the decor of the hotel - lobby sitting area had plenty of room to relax - and our rooms were done in black and white which gave it a nice crispness. Staff were helpful, rooms were cleaned quickly in the mornings when we left. Room had widescreen tv, coffee maker, large closet with ironing supplies and hair dryer, plus a safe. No AC but ceiling fan and the small opening permitted in the window was sufficient. Did not need the radiator but one was available. Would use again and do recommend, Greetings!

But there are numerous excellent hotels to choose from. So why the Omni? Because the staff there make us feel at home! When we arrive, the bellmen greet us by name, and make sure we are quickly escorted to our room, that our luggage is suitably placed in our room, that we are provided with amenities such as ice, water, an extra rack for our luggage, newspapers, wifi, and the like. As members of the Omni's Select Guest program we are often given upgraded rooms and provided in-room breakfast and beverages at minimal cost, along with early arrival and late check-out privileges, when available, and free wifi. Often this is accompanied by a late afternoon snack of special cheeses and fruits. These particular amenities are for Select Guests. But even without them we are made to feel special and welcome by the staff. And it's the staff that makes Omni seem more special by far than other upscale hotels where we have stayed. As some other reviews have stated, all this is not cheap. But in our opinion is it most certainly worth every penny. The more often you stay at the Omni in San Francisco, especially if you join their Select Guest program, the more certainly will the staff come to treat you like family. We have never experienced this elsewhere. The Omni San Francisco is an incredible gem that has to be experienced to be fully appreciated. Try it. Dear William P, Thank you for taking the time to leave us some feedback about your stay! It sounds like you and your wife had another nice visit to San Francisco, I'm glad that Omni San Francisco is your home away from home. We look forward to welcoming you back again soon.

Then to receive a gorgeous card which had not only been signed by several Omni team members, but also included personal notes, a plate of freshly cut fruit, a room upgrade, and an early check-in (we arrived at 9:00 am because of a very early flight), along with help in operating the Uber app (our first time using Uber) was unbelievable.

The hotel is central on California Street, about a 25 minute walk to Pier 39 and less to Pier 33 for the Alcatraz tours. The room we booked was a twin, it was very roomy and the beds of a reasonable size, not as big as some, but acceptable for my wife and I to sleep ok. The room also comes with a coffee machine rather than a kettle, making tea a little tricky for us Brits, however a short call to reception remedied that with a kettle promptly sent to the room. We had breakfast in the hotel on the first morning, this was a hearty breakfast and set us up for the rest of the day, that said it as $110 dollars for 3 of us including tip. Just a 10 minute walk from the Omni there is a farmers market on a Saturday morning and there are some great options for breakfast or lunch here, as well as tonnes of fresh local produce (monster strawberries). The concierge desk proved to be very useful and I have to single out Henry for his extensive local knowledge, superb customer service and friendliness, although everybody we encountered at the Omni was very helpful. The only disappointment was $15 per day internet charges, which in this day and age I thought was bizarre as all other hotels we stayed at during our holiday had this included and this is my reason for giving the Omni only 4 stars. This is a big hotel, but with small hotel service and attitude and you find the whole team very attentive. We payed $798 for 3 nights including all local taxes, hardly cheap but this is SFO and prices are high for most things here, that said the location was pretty central for last things we needed and Henry's assistance really helped maximise our time in the city to see everything we had planned and a few things we didn't (Do try to get to 'Twin Peakes') A taxi from SFO airport was just over $50 with tip.",

The only suggestion I have is to offer free Wi-Fi seems standard nowadays for most hotels.",

Upon coming back from dinner, instead of the traditional turndown service, we arrived back at our room to strawberries and a bottle of champagne, as well as robes and roses laid out on our bed.

It's a financial district hotel right on the edge of Chinatown and close to the Ferry market, but what makes this hotel superb is the the service! We dropped our bags at the front desk with the porter about noon and shortly after that we were texted when an early check in became available. Every single person from doorman to porter, front desk staff, concierge and housekeeping all without exception greeted us professionally and cheerfully and truly made us feel welcome. From the pictures you can see that the hotel lobby is beautiful! And our signature king room was well appointed and meticulously clean. The bedding was luxurious and beyond comfortable. Yes management is doing something right here. There is a universal culture of service that permeates the entire organization. Every team member went out of their way to provide personalized service and they all seem genuinely happy doing it. I was impressed with each and every interaction. Great job! Great culture! Keep up the good work! And thanks for helping to make our San Francisco vacation spectacular. Enjoy your stay here. Forget about a car. Use the Muni public transportation services or uber!",

I had phoned earlier in the day as our train was then running over 2 hours late, which would have meant us getting there sometime after 9pm. No problem at all they'd just note that we would be late. As it happened the train made up a bit of time so it was OK. However when we stepped inside the foyer, I thought, 'what is this'. The ceiling had bare pipes running along it. There were sculptures made of scrap metal by the lift. However checkin was swift and efficient, and our luggage arrived within 5 minutes. The quirkyness comes from the shipping/marine/fishing vibe that runs through the hotel, the pipework in reception being part of it. Part of the wall in the lobby area is a bit of an old shipping container, as was the wall behind our bed. The carpet design is sort of like a fishing net and the wall art reflects the sea. The lifts are decorated with a tale of whaling. I suppose you could argue that the place lacked a bit of soul with its straight lines of rooms, but I didn't feel that. We actually had a view, albeit of the carpark, but it made us feel less closed in than at other hotels on our travels (other than The Langham of course!). Also I didn't have to ask for a coffee machine and there was a sofa as well as a chair. Fridge and safe are also provided, and the bed was really comfortable. Position wise it is excellent. There is an IHOP next door, a CVM pharmacy for milk and booze two blocks away, and Pier 39 and Hard Rock Cafe are only a ten minute walk. There is a Joes Crab Shack about three blocks away. The Concierge arranged for our shuttle to the airport when we left, which was so much cheaper than a taxi (and provided a free tour of the city for other pickups!) Checkout was quick and easy, and when him indoors realised he'd left his reading specs they were already at reception for us. Good hotel. Would recommend",

I find it hard to believe that an \"upgrade\" constitutes a Murphy bed and while I had a bay view, being right on the street is extremely loud, especially when you try and nap in the middle of the day to combat serious jet lag. In addition, when I got to my room, I noticed that the provided soap is a Lime Coriander scent, which I am allergic to. I went to the front desk and explained I had an allergy to coriander and what other options did they have and I was told none. There was no attempt to help make an accommodation or to say \"we'll make sure to get your something\" . Finally I had to ask where the CVS was so I can purchase my own items. But those are small things. I wanted a hotel with a central location. It was. I wanted more of a boutique feel, and it was. The feel of the hotel was causal which I did want. There were a lot of families there and it was nice to be in a hotel that wasn't all about business travel. It wouldn't be a place I would stay again, but if you are looking for something in Fishermans Wharf, this fits the bill.",

For me though it was a little too far out when it came to the evenings as very very expensive down on the wharf to eat and drink. You can get cable or street cars around but because we walked everywhere mainly we didn't buy a pass for the few days and single journeys worked out expensive. This is a personal choice though as the hotel itself is great. The Z team is one of a kind and makes the Zephyr the place to stay when in San Francisco.

I love all the red, white, blue theme in the rooms. The rooms are small, but efficient use of the small space. The rooms are good for small families with two kids, single guests, and couples. The location of the hotel is excellent, because PIER 39 is across the street. My only problem with the hotel was the hidden fees. Guests have to pay a $50 parking fee for overnight stay. I stayed for 3 nights, and I had to pay $150. There is a hidden resort fee of $18. And then there is the state tax of $40 a day for my hotel stay. I am not liking the parking fees or the other additional fees. Overall great hotel with many hidden fees. I spent a lot of money on convenience of the hotel and location.

The Zephyr is centrally located with easy walking access to a lot of SF's tourist and food spots..it was really convenient. The only negatives I'd say are that the fridge size is deceiving. It looks like a medium sized fridge from the outside but when you open it, the actual fridge is teeny tiny so there isn't much room for stuff. And, the parking was expensive.

However, the one room you had to deal with a few steps. That room was very loud at night since there were lots of people outside.

All options for gotels in fisherman wharf area are overpriced and so can get away with this sort of attitude. Would try and find somewhere else further away.

I am very disappointed and embarrassed to hear that our housekeeping staff didn't take excellent care of you while you were here. I will be sure to share your comments with the entire team and thank you for brining this to my attention. You are correct, we do not manage a restaurant in the hotel; however, if you do come back and see us again, in addition to our camper in the yard, there is a full service restaurant attached to the building.

Service was wonderful from the valet parking to the bellman (Anthony was such a nice guy!), the various people at the front desk, and the concierge (be sure to ask for coupons/discounts before going out to eat - they saved us some money at a very nice place on Pier 39 (Fog Harbor)). Upon check in, the hotel gave us a free upgrade to a partial bay view with balcony, and the view was fantastic (I realize not everyone will get this upgrade, but I appreciate that they did this without any asking or prompting on my part). The room was clean and more than enough space for 4 people and a large amount of luggage (we had just spent 5 nights in Yosemite). The hotel is generally very modern and artistic in its theme, but not in an annoying or tacky way. We all found it quirky in a good way. On top of the great accommodation, the location was fantastic - just a block from Pier 39, and easy walking distance to anything in Fisherman's Wharf (and yes, I know it's a tourist trap, but that was fine, as we were tourists). We took the National Park ferry to Alcatraz, and the Zephyr was a very easy walk to the pier. Just be aware that, being so close to this tourist area, it can sometimes be loud at night (some kids busking a couple blocks away were a bit too enthusiastic on the drums one night, but it wasn't horrible). If I ever stay in San Francisco again, I would book the Zephyr in a heartbeat.",

The hotel is in a great location in fishermans wharf and close to all the fishermans wharf attractions and dining. Nearby the cable car to get up to Union Square also. The room was really nice and comfortable as was the bed. Loved the porthole style window and magnetic dartboard in the room. Unlike some other reviews I read, we actually found the front desk staff very helpful and friendly providing us with directions to get to places and info on the street cars. Also we arranged and paid for a very late checkout on our last day due to a late flight, and this did not seem to be a problem for them having to shuffle things around. The hotel is quite funky which we really enjoyed and and loved our stay there. We will definately stay with them when we return. Thanks Hotel Zephyr. Colin and Tracey",

Kids games, patio complete with pizza oven and a Popeye wall painting that had me smiling each time I visited reception.

Relatively clean (needs a little more attention in the bathroom area) but beds are comfortable and it's close to Fisherman's Wharf and the San Francisco Bay. Valet parking is $55/ day and the valet is at the ready to help. Here's the thing: we found our rooms to be noisy (right next to the parking garage, lots of beeping and car noise.) The quality is inconsistent: one room had a \"do not disturb\" sign the other didn't. There was a small canister in the bathroom that you'd expect to find cotton balls and swabs in: empty. Used the coffee first day; it wasn't replaced for day 2. The neighborhood is up and coming but not there yet so I'd be wary of walking around late at night. Not much food in the hotel but the 7 Eleven is around the corner as is IHOP. This place is cute and trendy but good / fair and great are different things. Small upgrades would help: like real glasses in the room vs. paper cups and replacing the items guests use every day. Just sayin'-- I've stayed in a lot of nice small hotels and the details they miss here separate the men from the boys. If all you need is cool decor, this is enough but I'd expect a wee bit more for the price.

We never want our service to be lower than excellent. There are many locations of rooms in the building and lots of views.

Dear Billy E, Your detailed notes are outstanding about your stay at Hotel Zephyr, thank you. I too love our location and find it super easy to get just about anywhere in city on public transit. We take safety & security very seriously and require key card access to all exterior doors with the exception of our front doors. We do have two security guards patrolling the property at night, please rest assured they are here and present. Our balcony rooms overlooking the yard are fantastic and yes, do not face the streets. The sounds of the city can be loud at times, for softer sleepers we do have ear plugs available. We do hope to see you again and hope that you will experience one of our balcony rooms next trip. Safe Travels, Jason",

      "content": "The Hotel Zephyr feels like an aging 3-star hotel that recently received a artistic \"re-skinning\" on this inside. The pervasive nautical theme is well executed. The location (about a 2-5 min walk from Fisherman's Wharf and Pier 39) is well located for visiting the tourist zone, making it an obvious choice for international visitors. Room noise is certainly an issue in this hotel. You can clearly hear footsteps above you, or bathroom use next to you. A larger issue was with my room (located on the 3rd floor near the parking elevator), which featured a loud motor/compressor noise resonating from the 4th floor. The compressor would go off for 5-10 minutes every hour all night, waking me up several times during the evening. If you are at all noise sensitive (usually, I am not bothered), make sure you are far away from this elevator. Additionally, the parking here (and across the street at the Sheraton) is an absolute rip off. If you are willing to walk less than a block away, you can find daily parking for less than half the price at Impark. Ultimately this is a lovely, basic, tourist oriented hotel in a popular area. A solid three-star option all around (from room amenities, room cleanliness, facility amenities, and staff friendliness).",

It is located in the middle of a heavily trafficked tourist area at the Fisherman's Wharf, so if touristy isn't your thing, then choose elsewhere. We chose the tourist area for safety for a mother/daughter trip. The rooms are roomy; the staff is very friendly and helpful; it's a block from Pier 39 that has tons of shops and restaurants. The price is comparable to most SF hotels. The only downside is that because it's in a tourist area, the streets surrounding the hotel are very crowded and the hotel is surrounded by tons of tacky stores. We recommend making this an annual Mother/Daughter trip, truevans! The Z team and location are just a few of the reasons that make the Zephyr the place to stay in the Wharf.

The bath / shower filled quickly as you showered and didn't drain away so it was very unpleasant. The noise of people leaving early and coming in very late could be easily heard - there seemed to be little if any soundproofing. The porterage staff were very friendly and helpful. IHOP a few doors down was a good place for breakfast . The lifts didn't always work so it was easier to go up and down the stairs .",

I actually found it quite difficult to give it a rating - in some areas it is excellent, and in others it's just a little strange! The location is outstanding - right on the front at Fisherman's Wharf and central for everything. If location is your main priority I don't think you can do any better. We had no problems with noise, despite what other reviewers have said. Our room was at the back, overlooking Beach Street, but we didn't have any problems and slept soundly every night. Our room was also very clean, tidy and comfortable, if a little on the small side. It has modern fixtures and fittings and some interesting 'maritime' themed bits and bobs, which made it feel different and quirky. The room service was consistently great - we hung the privacy label on the door every night and were never disturbed before we left the room to head out for the day. The outside area is also very cool - lots of comfy seating, fire pits and games to play. We felt the outdoor area was a little wasted though - there is no 'real' food or drink facilities, just a caravan with a (very) limited range of drinks and snacks, that seemed to be open inconsistently. How much of an issue this is for you will depend on what you plan to use the hotel for - my wife and I would have liked to chill out with a drink and some food in the outdoor area, and make the most of the facilities, but this wasn't really possible. There is a fridge in the room and an ice bucket, but no glasses. We asked at reception for glasses and were told they don't have any - we were offered small plastic beakers instead, and you have to request fresh ones every day. Not a massive issue, but it seemed strange to us to provide a fridge and ice bucket without any way of actually making use of them! We also had issues with the toilets blocking. The toilet in our bathroom blocked twice during our stay and we had to ask reception to get it sorted. Whilst our toilet was blocked my wife and I separately visited the public restrooms on two occasions and found the toilets blocked there also. Overall we enjoyed our stay and if we visit SF again we will definitely consider it. Our location makes it ideal for all the tours and sights to see in the Wharf, Paulrproctor, and you certainly made the most of it! We hope to see you again on your next SF adventure.

Public transport (trolly bus) is right out the front of the Z (outside the Longshoremen building). There isn't a restaurant here but the caravan in the courtyard offers beverages and snacks. There is an IHOP next door and plenty of restaurants around the corner. Staff are friendly and helpful, especially guest service officer, Q. Q went above and beyond to help us on our first day and is a credit to the Z crew. We were also accommodated with a late check out on our last day which was greatly appreciated due to our late night flight back to Australia. We would definitely stay here again.

      "content": "The room itself was clean and functional with nice modern electronics and the individual detail that I was expecting. Porthole, map of the bay area on the ceiling, funky decorations, and a sleek new bathroom. Zero complaints whatsoever. The common areas are clearly shown on the hotel site, but nowhere near the full flavor of what they are. Beyond fun things indoors and out for kids between the ages of probably 6 and 76. I saw people of all ages playing the oversized games at all hours of the day and night, and people making friends around the fire pits in the courtyard in the evenings and at night. The gym was wonderfully equipped for a hotel and I was able to make great use of the 24-hour availability. Food truck in the courtyard seemed popular at all hours. It was a short walk to a 24-hour convenience store around the corner and the full spectrum of boardwalk tourist favorites was, again, around the corner. Easy access to all forms of public transportation. Even nice view of the city from my regular old room type. If you're looking for a funky place in a prime tourist location, go for it. The Zephyr brings out the kid in all of us, EdwardWNYC! It makes coming to \"work\" everyday so easy. The Z team and I loved having you and can't wait to do it all over again. Until next time..Cheers, James",

Employees all were excellent. Rooms very neat, very comfortable. Great TV, Free Wifi. Location on Fisherman Wharf is hard to beat. Will stay there again for sure and I have recommended to my company to add it to the list of hotels to put people up in. You found your new home in SF, Don R!

      "content": "I am very unhappy with my stay at Hotel Zephyr. At the time of booking, all sites were showing a per night cost of under $200 for my room. I booked directly through the hotel website with the same price. Imagine my surprise when I checked out and the price was double what I booked at. I was with my friend who saw the price at the time I booked and confirmed. When I spoke to the manager about the issue she was completely unhelpful. This hotel DOES NOT include price confirmation in their emails if you book online, and because I didn't have this, the manager did not believe me, did not offer any help, and was completely uncaring about the situation. I see that someone else had this same situation at the same time - no one will listen or offer any help with the situation. Reservations tells me to call the front desk, the front desk doesn't care. DO NOT book through their site, only use third party sites if you're staying here. Dear Aspi1985, It is never our intention to charge the wrong rates or appear deceptive. I would be happy to look into your specific situation if you would please forward me your confirmation number and dates of stay. The other comment you reference was resolved quickly and was just a misunderstanding - I am certain we can get to the bottom of this as well. My email address is GM@hotelzephyrsf.com - please forward your confirmation letter from us as well and that will help me identify any errors that my have occurred. Warm Regards, Jason",

Mostly looks ok but did notice some things didn't work well or were broken ie: poor drainage in bath and basin, lamp only had a couple of globes working and lights over side table not working at all. Rooms neat enough and comfy beds but could do with a detail clean. Room was pretty noisy. Could hear people in other rooms above and next to ours and heard pipes rumbling thru the walls a few times and could always hear people walking past our door. Not a major problem for me but if you are a light sleeper probably choose a different hotel. Was woken up by house keepers 3 mornings out of 5 at 8:30 & 9:30am as they wanted to service the room which I found disgraceful and another day it wasn't serviced at all. I was compensated after complaining which was appreciated. Have travelled the world and stayed in a lot of hotels and never been annoyed by house keepers so much. Hopefully management see this and fix that problem. Overall a pretty good hotel and certainly well located but nothing else that great about it. Would I stay again? Probably not. Plenty of other hotels well situated too. The location is the perfect home base to see all our great city has to offer. We know we will knock your next stay out of the park, nb5555.

A couple of nights they had live music early on by differrnt young groups playing covers. You can get a room with a balcony which gives outdoor space. Not really a view but good to get some air. I had morning sun, but ask for a room with afternoon sun. Fridge in room but no mini bar, this did mean fridge space to stock up much more cheaply from local shops. Free WiFi. Friendly staff. Pets allowed and there was 2 nights when a dog barked almost consistently for 2 hours I love the live music in the Yard too, Julie B! Perfect way to unwind with a glass of wine or a beer after a busy day of exploring the Wharf. The waterfront balcony rooms offer amazing views of the bay and Alcatraz, especially at sunset!

They claimed this room they gave me was an upgrade because it was available early if not, they would charge for checking in early. Overall it was a nice place. Always a win when the teenagers are happy, Janeedoe415! The Yard and Game Room are perfect for sharing in on the family fun. The balcony bay view rooms are definitely worth it, we will have one ready for you next time. Cheers, James",

      "content": "I'm not even at the hotel yet and already I've experienced a horrible experience. I wasn't even allowed to speak to the GM because as well you know my message would NOT be reached or heard. So here I am as I will post to all social media sites my experience until I receive some injustice. I booked my 3 nights for June at a special Advanced Purchase Rate for $295/nt. I thought it's a great deal so sure why not I'll pay up front for the room because my trip is set and I don't plan to cancel. It's non-refundable, change or cancel. I booked the room on May 3rd. On May 4th the rate dropped to $239. I thought is this a fluke? Literally right after I booked it. I waited over the weekend to determine the rate will go back up and I wouldn't feel like I just got duped. I checked on May 9th and the rate is still at $239. I called the hotel, transferred many times and finally spoke to reservations manager name Robin (with no last name of course). She basically said no in many other different ways. Normally these rates are locked in by customers so we know, or at least feel, that we got a good rate. Each day that goes on customers usually see rates go up, NOT decrease. She tells me sorry nothing we can do bc it's an Advanced Purchase Rate. I understand how it works, but literally the next day??? That's NOT how customer service works, nor how rates are changed so suddenly. Somehow I feel scammed. She said I can accommodate 1 day of free breakfast for 4 at IHOP. She tried to explain to me what IHOP is (she speaks to me as if I'm stupid after I asked her several times what is this restaurant called and she wouldn't give me the name). I said no, I don't even eat at IHOP. You might as well give me a voucher for McDonald's. So basically I got nothing. Obviously this is not a luxury hotel so this is what I get for staying here. I thought well the kids would like it and Fisherman's Wharf is fun for kids. I should have heed the reviews on how some of the customer service is bad. So here's my question, will the GM contact me back? And yes I will write another review after my stay and experience. However, I'm already disappointed and my stay partially ruined. Thank you ROBIN for speaking to me like I only have a 5th grade education. Greetings Victoria T, I am so glad we were able to connect and resolve the confusion with our reservations team and solve this to your satisfaction. We always try to put our best foot forward and be as up front as possible about our pricing. Prices are always subject to change without notice and I always recommend locking in your price as early as possible. Please feel free to connect with me again if you have any further questions. Warm Regards, Jason",

After the shakey start, and concerns having read the reviews about noise, we all slept very well (husband doesn't normally sleep well but he said bed was v comfortable), the room was great (good size room, fridge, lovely window seat, good sized bathroom and charging/plug unit on desk) and location is perfect to see the main sights. The games inside and quad kept our son amused and was a highlight. The camper serving drinks (alcoholic and non-alcoholic) was good too.
