      "content": "My wife and I spent one night here this past weekend. The hotel was a great value for the price. We had an interior room (by choice) so we had no view, but we also didn't have any street noise. The room was nice, clean, and comfortable. It was cozy, but there was enough room for the two of us. The room had a small refrigerator, nice sized bathroom, and full closet with a safe. We experienced excellent service from check-in through check-out. We arrived earlier than official check-in time, but were lucky enough to have a room available. They offered to help us with our luggage, but we only had a small bag. (If the room was not available, they would have stored our bag). We dropped off the bag and ran right out to explore the city, but when we got back there was a message from the front desk staff making sure everything was ok. We checked out early the next morning, but stored our bag until the evening, with no problems. We would definitely stay here again.",

      "content": "The Fitzpatrick Grand Central is a smaller and older hotel in Midtown NYC. The hotel is homey and comfortable and the rooms are well represented on the Fitzpatrick website. The bathroom appeared to be recently remodeled and everything was extremely clean throughout the hotel. What sets this hotel above many is the quality of the staff. Everyone was very helpful and accommodating and went above and beyond to make our stay a memorable one. Kudos to Max who offered various restaurant choices and took time to make a reservation on our behalf. My only negative comment about this hotel is that there were no drawers in which to put clothing. There were two small bedside tables, but the drawers were very small for this purpose. All in all, we thoroughly enjoyed our stay at the Fitzpatrick and would recommend it to other travelers.",

Rooms are comfortable and serviced daily. Free wifi in the lobby otherwise it's 14.99 usd per day. There's a fridge in the room. White robe and good towels. Good shower. Comfortable bed.

Despite its name I was expecting US staff, but they are almost all Irish, which made for fabulous hospitality. All the staff were incredibly welcoming and nothing was any trouble. We stayed in two rooms during our stay, as we were offered an upgrade to a suite. The first room, their standard, was not as small as I was expecting, there was plenty of room to store everything and we had a view of 44th street, which we liked. We were then upgraded to a suite, which was lovely - it was a huge room! However, it's positioning was not as favourable in my opinion as it was above the bar/patio area, so the bathroom door needed to be closed to keep the room quiet, and there was no view. The bed was awesome though, absolutely huge. I would recommend this hotel for its hospitality and location.",

      "content": "Had a short break at Fitzpatrick's Grand Central Hotel and would recommend it thoroughly. From the moment we stepped into Fitzpatrick's to the time we left, and everything in between, it was a great hotel. Although I noticed the staff are not mind readers. I say that because one guest was saying, for example, they had no kettle in their room. I don't know if that is standard not having a kettle but we had not got one in our room but a quick call to reception and we had one in two minutes plus milk plus extra tea bags. In fact, the staff could not do enough to make your stay as enjoyable as possible. If there is one stand out feature if Fitzpatrick's it is the staff. We really liked our room and the bed was too comfortable. That is, you don't want to leave it!! A big television is in the room plus all the toiletries you need. But don't spend all your time in the room as New York has too much to see and do that it would be sinful to stay in bed too late. The Wheeltapper bar in the hotel was really enjoyable. If you are into old CIE (Irish Transport Company) memorabilia then you are in for a treat as there are old photographs, train signs and other items that shows the Irishness of the pub. It can be fairly packed but that adds to the atmosphere like a traditional Irish pub. They serve food and we had breakfast served in the pub, which was delicious. Again, get to know the staff as they are extremely helpful. There is a mixture of Irish and American and other staff who work well together in providing a great service throughout the hotel. Some people said that they thought Fitzpatrick's was a dear hotel to stay in. Well it is not the cheapest but it is in a superb location right around the corner from Grand Central Station, which is one of the biggest and best stations I've ever come across and well worth a visit in it's own right. You will get cheaper hotels no doubt but I'd personally rather pay that bit extra for a class hotel. By the way, don't be afraid to engage with the concierges as they know New York well. They can get you discounts for various attractions and are really helpful in sorting out your travel arrangements on the subway and so on. I'm sure there are things I've left out but my overall view is what I wanted to get across. Engage with the staff. They are the friendliest bunch I have come across.",

Everybody at the hotel was nice helpful and friendly nice people. New York is great lots to see and do but it's very very expensive so make sure you have plenty of cash. Meal for two 1 wine each and a main only will cost you $90 to $130 dollars in a normal restaurant. Bottle of water $3 Beer $8 glass of wine $9 a cake $4 a sandwich $6 just an ideal of prices. Most places add local tax and 20% service charge without asking on top. But if you can afford it it's a great place to enjoy. One free thing is the Long Island ferry it's goes straight passed the Statue of Liberty. The 9/11 museum is great do not miss it its worth the entrance fee. Also walk across the Brooklyn bridge that is also a great free thing to do. The open top hop on/off.BigBus at $28 per person is very good and well worth the money.",

      "content": "We stayed at the Fitzpatrick Grand Central mainly because of TripAdvisor reviews. We agree with those who reported friendly staff and a convenient location. However, during our first night the room was exceedingly hot as the air conditioner had frosted up and stopped working. We called housekeeping and Andrea came up to check on the situation. She saw the problem and offered to transfer us for the night to another room. We accepted and were given a junior suite with two air conditioners running. It was definitely cool enough! However, the room was very noisy as it was right over the pub patio. The noise continued until 11 p.m. Then all night long the air conditioners continued to shut off, start up, shut off, start up, over and over. The noise prevented me from sleeping for more than a few hours and I woke up exhausted. After that night we went back to our original room. While Andrea gave us two coupons for free breakfasts it really didn't make up for a basically sleepless night. My advice is to stay away from rooms anywhere near the pub patio and ask for a room with an air conditioning unit that works properly and quietly. Otherwise, don't stay here in the heat of the summer. With respect to the rooms, the beds are comfortable, the rooms are ordinary, the showers run hot/cold/hot/cold, so it is better to take a bath. Dear 20mar20, Thank you for staying at the Fitzpatrick Grand Central and for taking the time to post your review of the hotel. I am sorry to see that you rest was disturbed by noise and that you encountered a problem with the air-conditioning. We are in the process of replacing the older units in the guest rooms. Once again, thank you for choosing the Fitzpatrick Grand Central and please contact me directly at pleyden@fitzpatrickhotels.com if I can be of any assistance in the future.

It's a 15 minute walk to Time Square and or the Theater district. You can grab the subway to anywhere NYC from Grand Central. (The Oculis is a must see @ the base of One Freedom Tower.) The Hotel is clean and the staff was fantastic. The hotel is older but updated. We had a deluxe king room and with luggage for a two week tour the room was tight. If you want ice in your room you have to order it or get it in the pub... City noise at night, well it's the city and garbage trucks run and sirens go. The city that never sleeps. The beds are comfortable and the little coffee shop next door is great. I would stay here again. I would also like to mention a little diner at 135 E 50th. The New York Luncheonette. A great little place for breakfast and lunch. Happy Trails... Off to Phillie.

This was my first visit to New York and on learning that we were there to celebrate our joint birthdays, on our second day they upgraded us to a garden room on the penthouse floor. Fabulous room with our own rooftop garden ! On the day of our birthdays we returned to the room to find complimentary champagne and strawberries. All in all our stay with Fitzpatricks was amazing. I must mention Andrea and Shona on reception who made our stay so very special. The only thing I would mark the hotel down on is the cost of their breakfast - very expensive. Fitzpatricks Grand Central is situated midtown, across the road from Grand Central Station and close to Times Square, Rockefeller Centre, Central Park and of course Grand Central Station which is worth a visit for the architecture and shops. To get downtown, we didn't use the subway and found the yellow cabs to be quite inexpensive and quick although a bit nervewracking !! There is a flat rate of $52 from JFK to Manhattan and on top of this you need to add toll charges of $8 plus their tip. Fastest way to get from the airport to Manhattan. Dear Olinda23, Happy Birthdays and thank you for staying at the Fitzpatrick Grand Central. I am delighted to see that you had such an enjoyable experience with us and enjoyed your your upgrade amenities.

You are just around the corner from Grand Central Station which provides great access to trains and the subway. Room was good, great air conditioner, comfortable bed. Huge shower as it was an ADA room. Fresh towels daily, water and mints every day. Complimentary bath robe to use during your stay. Not sure if you will get charged if you keep it (better ask). No need for an umbrella because the room has one in it, and this they will charge you $25.00 if you decide to keep it. They will secure a $100.00 credit card deposit for \"incidentals\" or $200.00 cash. Upon checkout I was told this should get put back on the card in roughly 3 business days. They tried to charge us for a long distance call, but on that day we were out sightseeing. Basically keep track of stuff and always review your bill before you acknowledge payment. Staff was very courteous and professional. Rates are comparable to other hotels, but it is mid town Manhattan so prices are high anywhere you stay. Would I stay at the Fitzpatrick again? Considering it's proximity to getting around? Absolutely. Dear WWF4G, Thank you for staying at the Fitzpatrick Grand Central and for taking the time to post your review of the hotel on Tripadvisor. I am delighted to see that you had such an enjoyable experience with us and will look into the telephone charge issue. Once again, thank you for choosing the Fitzpatrick Grand Central and I do hope it won‚Äôt be too long before we have the privilege of welcoming you back to the hotel.

Its really central to most places that you want to visit in NY, but the property itself does not impress. Our room was really outdated, there was some patched up carpet in the room, the bathroom floor tile was chipped and not very clean, the towels were not great and were kind of hard. There was no dresser for clothing so we had to use the night table for clothes, the TV had pretty limited channels, the AC roared on and off all night, and they charge $15 for internet, which in today's day and age is almost free everywhere. So while the location was great the hotel is pretty outdated and the staff was pretty lame. Sorry Fitz, but we wont be coming back again. Dear sircaralot, Thank you for staying with us and for taking the time to post your review of the hotel on Tripadvisor. Despite enjoying the location I am very sorry to hear that we do not meet your expectations and that you had such a disappointing stay. Thank you for staying with us please let me know if I can be of any assistance in the future. Kind Regards, Patrick Leyden General Manager Fitzpatrick Grand Central Hotel",

It's well situated for walking to most of the main sites eg Times Square, empire state etc. Grand central station is a stones throw away. The local are feels safe. There is a bar attached to the hotel which is nice. However, Wed and Thurs is where the local city slickers socialise after work, and it can be quite noisy, but this is new york so I feel a little party atmosphere is to be expected and it did only go on until 11pm. Our rooms were at the back and on the 2nd floor which meant we could take advantage of the free wi fi in the lobby. Apparently rooms at the front are at risk of being able to hear the 24hr sounds of new York city, but think that would be bearable...it is new york after all.

The staff was quite eager to help with anything we wanted. We stayed in one of the Garden Rooms, which has its own private terrace on the roof and an incredible bathroom. If you're into having your own outdoor patio in the city, or you like large bathtubs and showers made for two, then this is the room for you. And there are only three rooms on the entire floor so it's unlikely you'll be disturbed. We were celebrating a birthday and the hotel sent us a complimentary bottle of champagne and some chocolate-covered strawberries as soon as we arrived. Nice touch! They also checked in with us each day to make sure we had everything we wanted. The only cons I have are these: - The restaurant connected to the hotel is just so-so. Not much of a variety and the food was mediocre. But there are plenty of other dining options in the area so this wasn't a big deal for us. - The handle on the bathroom door fell off. It happened about an hour before we were checking out so I just told them on my way out. They apologized more than once and asked if there was anything they could do to make it right. I'm sure it was taken care of immediately. The bottom line is I thoroughly enjoyed my stay here and would definitely stay again. Dear Leo P, Happy Birthday and thank you for staying at the Fitzpatrick Grand Central. I am very happy to read that you enjoyed your stay with us and that you enjoyed your amenity.

There was some noise from road works & construction going on in the area but that's to be expected in NYC - bring earplugs!

We arrived rather late due to a delayed flight and were shown to our room which was exactly the same as the room we had had before, although on a higher floor. Nothing wrong at all but rather small for two people with cases etc. Next morning we enquired whether it would be possible to get a larger room. The staff were very helpful and understanding and were happy to move us to a larger room at no additional cost. Our room was clean with TV and fridge and restocked with tea coffee and bottled water each day. On our first night due to the lateness of our arrival we had a meal in the pub come restaurant in the hotel. It was ok but nothing special and I wouldn't recommend eating here. However we were given a complimentary breakfast on our first day which was fine. On our last day as we had an evening flight they offered an extended check out time to 2pm.

Lovely hotel, rooms are nicely appointed with everything you need including a coffee maker, a little compact but you don't go to New York to spend time in your hotel room.. Nice bar and patio area to get a drink and eat, good food and not too expensive (although not cheap). The staff at the hotel were very warm and welcoming and we received great service especially from Laura who checked us in and organised a special meal for us and Thomas the duty manager, many thanks. A couple of little niggles, paid Wi-Fi in the rooms, it is 2017 guys it is no longer acceptable to pay extra in a hotel for Wi-Fi, you offer it free in the lobby so why charge in the rooms and the bar area. Air conditioning unit in the room was noisy and largely ineffective I noticed mention of this in previous reviews, this needs to be addressed the units look old and tired and should be changed. Overall a great place that I would definitely return to and recommend to others. Sort the couple of niggles out and it would be perfect.

The location was wonderful within walking distance of everything. Staff were so friendly and helpful and gave us lots of advice ,organising visits to tourist areas etc. They were always willing to help and always with a smile! Lobby area was very welcoming and a comfortable place to sit and relax, really felt like a home from home by the end of the week.Food was lovely and rooms were clean and homely. The bar and restaurant had a lovely atmosphere and was suitable for families/ friends/ business trips.Only recommendation I would have is perhaps free wifi in the rooms as opposed to just the lobby area. Would highly recommend this hotel to anyone and we will be back!!",

It was raining out but just seemed a little humid the whole time. We ate at the \"pub\" next door. I don't recommend it. The hotel though, I would definitely return for a nice place to stay.",

After spending all day exploring the city we arrived back to the hotel were the staff greeted us everytime just like we really belonged there! I spoke with The concierge everyday who gave me the most amazing tips for New York and vegas where he worked before New York! We ordered room service one night also and it was the nicest meal we had in New York. I honestly couldn't imagine staying anywhere else in New York now. It felt so like home in such a big city.",

This was simply a leisure visit to the city and the hotel was chosen due to positive reviews as well as the central location. We arrived fairly early (I believe about 10:30am) and they were able to check us into a room right away. The staff were very polite and friendly. They do offer valet parking for $70 (that's the SUV price) per day. I drove to the next block and paid $53 for the day and parked it myself. The room was fairly small but clean and attractive. The AC unit fan functioned but it didn't adjust to temperature requests. It wasn't worth complaining about since we were only staying for the 1 night. I will say that I included a note with my original reservation and not any pet of it was acknowledged. Luckily they had a quiet (rear facing, higher floor) room available for us anyway. We went out for a walk shortly after checking in. When we came back to the hotel, the woman that checked us in came around her desk to give our son a toy train. This was a great gesture - especially considering he loves trains. The only negative with this hotel would be the restaurant but that is a separate review. The location is great and it's not on a busy street. We would certainly stay here again. It isn't a fancy place but we were comfortable and felt well cared for.",

The bed was amazingly comfortable, which coupled with the amount of walking I did each day, meant I slept soundly every night.I was fairly high up, but would still recommend you take earplugs. as you can hear street noise and if you have visited New York before you will know how noisy the streets can be, especially 7th Avenue The decor of myroom was very much in keeping with the lobby area of the hotel, with thick carpets and wallpaper¬†covered walls. I think it‚Äôs important to point out that this is not an ultra sleek modern hotel with Ikea style furniture, it is a homely and cozy and most of all comfortable. It is important to remember that The Wellington Hotel is a 3* hotel and even though the hotel is great value for money, you do in reality get what you pay for. The hotel is clean and comfortable, yes it is missing a few facilities and amenities that higher rated hotels may have and it may not be as modern and contemporary as other hotels in the city, This mid range hotel gets big thumbs up, and I will certainly love to stay here again in the future.",

The room had two windows which opened slightly to let in some air. The bathroom wasn't huge but enough room for what we needed. The bedroom also wasn't huge but again had plenty enough space for what we needed, bed was very comfy and pillows were nice & big too.

The bathtub stopper did not work. The elevators are very small and on the slower side. The staff is not very friendly. I found housekeeping friendlier, but the front desk staff need to put a smile on their faces and have better telephone etiquette.

Funny, but after a 14 hour travel day, a bit annoying with heavy bags. Thought it would have been nice to be greeted outside. Inside, the lobby is beautiful, art deco paintings, dramatic chandeliers, really love it. Old building but clean, no musky smells and management was very helpful in general. Went to the starbucks across the street (no coffee in rooms) most mornings. Great location to walk to many things, and easy to catch a subway if not close.Diner around the corner that was outstanding. Rooms not huge but not small.

When I got back to the hotel at 4 pm there were still breakfast leftovers from an adjacent room lying around in the corridor and bundles of laundry didn't make it easier to navigate back to my room. When leaving again a bit later I told the reception staff about it and they said they were going to call it in, but it felt like they really wasn't in a hurry with it. Internet pricing is a joke though. 4.99 USD for an hour and only two devices. Talk about rip off! GO over the street to Starbucks and it's free.....",

The staff were friendly and helpful, we were stopping for 10 days and when we paid for WiFi they gave us 5 days free. There were flaws with this hotel however, the room was small, there was barely room to move round the double bed. The room was hot and switching the air con only worked for awhile then it would pump out hot air. In the bathroom the toilet made the most horrendous noise when it flushed and if it got stuck on the flush the awful noise carried on for a while until it wasn't stuck. Maids would often try and get in the room when we had put out the 'Do not disturb' sign.",

Lifts are very old and very busy at rush hours.Rooms are extremely small.AC is very noisy. Rooms are very dark on courtyard side but probably more quiet than street / avenue side rooms.

We had a one bedroom suite but ended up having 2 bedrooms. Which was so handy with 2 young children. The hotel is not accessible unless by steps. The least being 4 steps. When you have a pushchair with shopping and 2 children it is heavy lifting it up and down. The bell boys never helped unless we asked. When I was alone with the children I had to wait 10 mins for anyone to help me. Not ideal with 2 young ones. The staff all seemed to have an attitude problem. The room is incredible outdated. There is no coffee and no safe. We had a microwave and a fridge that even on the warmest setting froze everything so in the morning when we wanted to give our children cereal we had to heat the milk up to defrost. The taps in the bathroom made the loudest screeching noise unless on full. Not ideal when you want to shower or bath and the kids are sleeping. The ac in the room was very old. Not great if you are staying here in the summer. Every bath tile in the bathroom seemed cracked and desperately needed redoing. The hotel lost one of my parcels. When I kept asking for it they got rude. I waited 7 hours until they found it. For the price we paid I would rather stay in a nicer hotel for with less space in the room for the same price. The lifts are very small and at busy times we had to wait several times before we could go down in the lift. Having the pushchair meant we couldn't go down 7 flights of stairs to reception. We also asked for 2 cots in the room. When we got there we had to call and wait for them to be put up. After a 13 hour flight and 2 hours in the taxi this wasn't ideal when we just wanted to put the kids to bed. Don't ask for any special requests on the booking form if you aren't going to honour them. Definitely won't be going back.",

The location is perfect between Central Park and Time Square for walking, with a subway one block away. Our group loved it! Though not all rooms had a balcony, my group's room did and had a great view of Time Square. A few of the others had a good window view looking towards Central Park.

First impressions where ok, staff friendly enough, lobby looked dated and in an old fashioned style. We were on the seventh floor . Now the room, granted it did look like the pictures on the site and TA in terms of the decor , which on the pics looked ok, up close and personal it was very dated indeed. The room was also quiet small, I've stayed in NYC twice before and it was smaller than a more budget priced hotel I'd stayed in. There was no wardrobe but a weird walk in cupboard, no light and few hangers. Our view was a brick wall and another window in spitting distance which looked as though it was in a room being refurbed, it meant we hardly opened the blinds and my daughter saw someone staring through one day whole looked like a work man. The bathroom was even smaller. I mean really tiny, stand up to brush your teeth then sit on the toilet tiny. We had problems with all the taps too which where really old, this meant the shower was hit and miss and we called the bath, more a stand for the shower the \"borrowers bath\" as they're the only people who could have actually bathed in it! It was also warm and we slept with the window open as the air con unit was like something out of the arc and really really noisey. A few positives though as it's not all doom n gloom. The bed was really comfortable , one of the best I've slept in and the location is brilliant. Two blocks down from Central Park, a two minute walk to a subway and minutes from Times Square . In fact this is the hotels main sell . I'm not saying there aren't nice rooms, just that we didn't see one.",

This time we allowed for our room to be cleaned while we were out for the evening and returned to find it as it should be. This hotel is not cheap and we were disappointed by this poor service.

So why do I give it only 3/5? NO WAY to get up and down stairs if you are in a wheelchair without having to wait for them to put up the portable ramp. Now, we are fortunate in that my daughter can walk up and down stairs (slowly!) and walk a few short steps, but so many people cannot. We decided it was easier to just have her walk up and down while two of us carried the wheelchair up and down. The first time we asked for the ramp we got an eyeroll! Some days the doorman would see us and offer to help carry it up/down, other days not. I never thought to ask if the lobby was accessible since they had accessible rooms! So bottom line: if mobility is not an issue, it a nice clean hotel, and close enough to walk to many attractions. However, if you are in a wheelchair this is not the hotel for you! Were the wheelchair not an issue I'd have given it 4.5/5--the half point being for the elevators being very very small!",

We'd arrived a day early and a bomb exploded in Chelsea so pressure was on. There was a little fist pump at finding this one under $200 USD. It boasted a view of Central Park.... so we lashed out a bit. Isn't this a reason to be here? 27th Floor! Although it's uncomfortable for us not being unable to regulate the air much in the room, we were really happy. Although the check in line was a sea of bags and weary travellers, we were still so excited. It's a great bargain. Even after dragging all our luggage straight through Times Square on a Saturday afternoon, we knew we'd got ourselves into a great location. (btw: I don't recommend walking with your gear ... of course we stood out like tourists. A young girl with some sort of preconceived bias towards our luggage, kicked at it as we went past. 'Never found out why she was so into suitcase bashing. It wasn't bad luggage and the poor thing was only a small wheelie one.) Once we settled into NY, we found the subway one of the easiest in US to get the hang of. In fact, once you're in there. navigating NY makes sense. This hotel is a great place to explore from. Just take your strong handbag though. They are looked on a lot. I mean looked on a lot more favourably.",

      "content": "this is our 2nd stay here, and perhaps the luster has rubbed away. when we first got in the room with the bellhop carrying our bags, the room was blisteringly hot. the bellhop looked at the (non-working) modern thermostat and said 'its automatic' well, really, if it didn't come on in this heat, it wasn't going to. Turns out, the old fashioned, radiator-like AC was by the window and it was off, so we switched it on. the Bellhop should have been well versed in how to cool the rooms. Nonetheless, the AC was weak at best. We spent the entire day out and when we got back, it was still warm, despite having set it to Hi Cool. It really needs to be replaced. we also had to wiggle the toilet flush in a variety of ways to get it to flush. and the drains for both the shower and the sink drained very slowly. As well, the bottom of the tub was very slippery and needed a good scrub of its sliminess. Not too appealing. this was on the 9th floor, where the elevators were slow and tiny, only able to accommodate 5 people at a time. on our last visit we stayed on the 4th floor and it was much better overall., though the room was smaller, and it was right over the busy street, everything was clean and worked well. And the cost of this room was crazy each night varied, I'll post: Sunday, 30 April, 2017 : $170.80 per Night Monday, 1 May, 2017 : $240.80 per Night Tuesday, 2 May, 2017 : $391.30 per Night Total Room Price : $802.90 City Tax $47.17 for all nights Occupancy Tax $6.00 for all nights State Tax $71.26 for all nights Visitor Tax $4.50 for all nights Total: $931.83 I get all the taxes, but the varying rate of each day was nuts!. Now this hotel is close to 5th Avenue and a lot happens here so it was close to a lot, as well as close to Central Park. On this visit though, we took UBER to many places further away, Wall Street, Brooklyn, etc. And there are a lot of good places to eat nearby, or stores to buy water and snacks. I'm sure we would stay here again, we would probably ask for a lower floor room. If you're in a hurry, upper floors don't cut it with the slow elevator.",

Why must these establishments charge for such a service, it's just pure greed and spoilt my stay.

The room was small (too small for two people) but clean and pleasant: typical interior for a boutique hotel, in beige and blue color with classical looking furniture. Since I read all the negative reviews, i was on the watch out for bugs, i saw none. The bathroom was fine and clean and had a big window (unusual for hotels). The room decor was pleasant. My room was on the 9th floor overlooking the courtyard (that is the windows of other rooms, no view). the room was next to the elevator. I did not hear the elevator at all. The room was very quiet, you can hear in the background faint city noise and a low hum like from some air-conditioner way below. The window opens sufficiently to let air in. The heater/air-conditioner does not make more noise than expected. If the hotel was kept in a better shape it would have been quite quaint. The bed sheets were clean and crisp, but there was a hole in one sheet, the bathroom towels were tin at spots, the bathroom fixtures were missing some caps, the night lamp had to be twisted in a specific angle in order to work, the curtains were very dusty and grayish rather than white color. The water pressure was strong but the shower head was no good and rather than a shower it was pouring the water.

As soon as we arrived, we had a warm welcome where we were quickly checked in and given our room keys. Prior to our booking we requested a city view on a high floor of the hotel which they provided for us, giving us a room on the 26th floor with absolutely stunning views of Central Park. Me and my parents shared a room and it was brilliant as there was a wall which separated the two beds to give some privacy with an en suite next to both bedrooms. The rooms were spacious with two windows and brilliant views! From lying in my bed, all I had to do was look straight ahead where I could see the skyline, I could lie in the bed all day! Rooms were spotless with the cleaner coming in everyday while we were out so we always come back to a tidy room. The location of the hotel was brilliant as my mum struggles with walking too far due to us being less than a 5 minute walk from Times Square. Central Park was also less than a five minute walk away and popular attractions such as the Rockefeller Centre and Empire State Building being a few blocks away. There are subway stops right outside the hotel entrance with two ways to get to the hotel, the front entrance has heaters to keep guests warm if they are standing outside. There are also plenty of restaurants and shops right outside the hotel so you don't need to go far. There are plenty of leaflets and brochures downstairs in the lobby for guests to find out about local restaurants, attractions and sightseeing tours so you can make the most of your stay. There are also plenty of comfy seats if you fancy a rest in the lobby although there is a gift shop and cafe joined to the hotel with entrances in the hotel lobby for people who are staying at the Wellington. We never visited the shop but we went to the cafe a couple of times for a hot chocolate or milkshake. We didn't purchase any food but from the looks of others, they offered good portions and excellent quality. All members of staff were talkative and very friendly, giving you a warm welcome and forming a good rapport. Overall, the Wellington Hotel was brilliant for us and we had no problems.

If further, then the subway, taxis, and hop-on/hop-off buses are immediately available for a reasonable fee. The hotel is rated 3.5 with many of the accommodations of a larger rated hotel. The standard one-bedroom was reasonably priced, adequate in size, with a small one-person clean bathroom. The staff were helpful and knowledgeable. The valet parking was $35 per 24 hour period was very reasonable in comparison to comparable hotels. You are out and about most of the day visiting the sights and sounds of the area. It was a nice stay at reasonable cost. We plan on returning back to NYC in the future and plan on staying at the Wellington once again. No, I am not paid to provide this information, simply a survey by the Trip Advisor.",

We have stayed in other NYC hotels and even though it's just the two of us, we are usually climbing over each other and have no room to put things. Not the case at The Michelangelo! So much room, so comfortable! Our room was recessed from the front of the hotel, so our view was of a little courtyard. You could see the street from a small distance. We were on the fifth floor. Not sure if all the Jr Suites are like that. But it made it extremely quiet. We were off the elevator, and I got a little worried, but we never heard it. Our room was immaculate. Housekeeping came while we were out and the room always looked nice. The staff was friendly and professional. The location is convenient. We highly recommend The Michelangelo.",

      "content": "We went on our family vacation to New York and stayed at the Michelangelo hotel. It is very close to Times Square and there is a small shop near by to get items you need like water (at a reasonable price) and snacks. When you enter the Michelangelo, you get the feeling that it is an older hotel. The lobby should be updated with newer furniture. The check in person was very nice and helpful. The room was spacious (which is what we wanted for this vacation); however, there were stains on the carpet (so that should be addressed). We also had a stain on our bed cover but called immediately and it was replaced -- but I was surprised that when they brought it up to us that they didn't fix the bed -- they just handed it to us and took the stained one. They only gave us 3 towels and 1 roll of toilet paper which wasn't enough. You have to request more if you want them. There was construction outside of the hotel and we were woken up at midnight two nights in a row by a jackhammer! Not pleasant! The door man never opened the door for us (except when we first arrived). Overall, the room was nice though and we enjoyed the room. The Michelangelo is close to everything but not right in the middle of Times Square. It was a good location because of this. Use the subway for about $2.50 per person, it is worth it to travel this way instead of Uber or taxi in the city. Uber from Michangelo to the Freedom Tower was about $35 vs. subway at $7.50 for three of us.",

I called up and discussed the situation with a staff member in reservations. I offered to pay for the first night I wouldn't be there and then the second night when I would be there. Somehow, the only response was \"if you aren't in the hotel by midnight then we will cancel the reservation and charge you for just one day.\" As I was concerned that the hotel would be fully booked I persisted to suggest that it made sense to simply modify the agreement as they had already agreed that their policy was to not charge me for the last two nights I was cancelling. I also pointed out that the concept that I paid for the first night and would be there for the second night would logically hold my reservation on the second night. The gentleman on the phone was unable to get a supervisor on the phone after putting me on hold for a while. When he came back he said the supervisor was unavailable and would give me the same answer. The solution - while waiting for the supervisor. I booked the same room on line for $40 bucks less. Then i told the operator to go ahead and cancel the original reservation. I rightfully paid for the unoccupied first night and then reduced my cost to the hotel by 40 bucks on night two. I run a 5000 employee business and would be appalled if this were my operation. By refusing to think the issue through the hotel lost money. Hopefully, I'll enjoy the hotel tomorrow. I have several times in the past. We appreciate your review and feedback, Scott.

Not directly in Time Square which is what we wanted. Will definitely be back. Thank you for the outstanding review, Diane! We're delighted your experience with us was so wonderful! We endeavor to make all of our guests feel welcome and relaxed during their time with us. It's fantastic our team could accommodate your needs and assist you in any way possible.

      "content": "Location: in the heart of the theatre district. Times Square is literally around the corner but noise was surprisingly minimal in our room on the 5th floor (noise was mainly sirens from ambulances/police cars and not late night revellers). Within easy reach of Central Park, Rockefeller Centre, Radio City, Bryant Park, NY Public Library, St. Patrick‚Äôs church and Fifth Avenue shopping (about 10 ‚Äì 15 minutes walk from the hotel). Caf√© Duke is just a few doors down and open 24 hours. Great to grab a breakfast/lunch or even dinner (they have cooking stations for fresh pizza, Korean or pasta). Starbucks is over the road on 52nd and a better option than the hotel coffee in my opinion. Rooms: my family of 4 stayed in a room on the 5th floor overlooking the Winter Garden Theatre where ‚ÄòSchool of Rock‚Äô was performing. I emailed ahead to ensure we were provided with 2 x twin beds rather than a King and roll-away. The response from Michelangelo was prompt and friendly. We arrived at 1.30pm and our room was not ready; however, we knew check-in was 3pm so this didn‚Äôt bother us. We simply stored our luggage with the concierge and headed out to explore. When we returned at 4pm, we were not disappointed. Whilst not sleek and ultra modern, the room was very spacious and very much encapsulated the feel of Rome, which we loved. The bathroom was large with his and hers basins, a toilet, bidet and a huge bathtub with powerful and hot overhead shower. There was a separate dressing area with large storage cupboard between the bathroom and bedroom. We were even provided with a pastry/fruit platter and 2 large bottles of water on arrival which we thought was a nice touch. There were ample toiletries if you needed them, bathrobes, slippers and they had even thought of umbrellas for New York‚Äôs unpredictable weather. The beds were the most comfortable I have slept in. Having read an earlier review about the pillows being too soft, I could not disagree more. The mattresses were very deep and comfortable and yes, whilst you sink into the pillows, there are 2 of them per person and they are so big you could have folded them over if you‚Äôd wanted to. Amenities: we didn‚Äôt have much need to contact the hotel staff but when we did they were polite and very professional. Checkout is 12pm. On our last day, the doorman stored our luggage to allow us time to take in the final sights of NYC and booked a taxi to take us to the airport on our return. My only criticism of this hotel is the ‚Äòcharge‚Äô added to your bill at the end of the stay. I was aware of this when we booked through Expedia but it does leave me wondering exactly what I am getting for my money - $200 for 5 nights stay? This fee is applied for use of the hotel‚Äôs internet, use of a gym (I think) and a $10 credit that can be used daily against sundries. It would be nice if this was optional as we never used the gym, had 2 filter coffees one day (costing $10.89 + tip) which I‚Äôm afraid were not good, and yes, we used the internet but we never used up the remainder of our daily credits and they could not be carried forward to another day. Either incorporate this into your room rates (if it is not optional) or give your customers a choice to select internet, gym etc. Please note: the hotel no longer offer free buffet breakfast, tea/coffee or complimentary transport to Wall Street as is sometimes advertised on Google. We loved this hotel, the staff and its location. Well done Michelangelo! Dear Guest, Thank you for the outstanding review! We're delighted your experience with us was so wonderful!

The biggest sources of disappointment are the bathrooms (too small, too close to the bed, thus affording very little privacy), the mattress (on the softer side), and the hotel restaurant (I must admit I am not 100 percent sure if there is another dining option within the hotel, but I am pretty confident there's none, because that's where the breakfast is served and other meals too). The restaurant on the first floor was more of a lounge. While the place itself is cosy, I would have liked to see a wider breakfast selection. This being a boutique hotel, some of the requests that would normally be answered positively in other larger hotels like hyatt were turned down here. For instance, when I asked for a tea kettle, they had none available to place in the room. However, I was able to get hot water to go at the restaurant downstairs. The service was very friendly. All in all, a good hotel, but I'd probably not stay there again. Thank you for the review, Marina. We apologize that your visit with us did not exceed expectations and was disappointing. We hope that the inconveniences during your stay did not impact your stay in NY too much. Have a nice day.",

We found this hotel to have an Old World feel, but in need of some updating. It looked tired and definitely in need of some updating of decor. We did not like the fact that there was not a market or even drink/snack machines on-site. My husband and I had to go down the street each day to get drinks and snacks. We also didn't like the fact that the internet wifi kept having to be redone by putting your room number and last name to sign on. On the other hand, the bed was extremely comfortable! The best thing about this hotel was the location. We would recommend it highly, if you are looking for a great hotel in close proximity to Broadway. We appreciate your feedback, Lisa.

      "content": "So I travel to NYC a few times a year and at least once with a good friend(s) for a girls long weekend. I try to visit different hotels (although I've gone to the midtown Andaz more than once because of good experiences- but I digress because this review is about the Michelangelo). I did some research and the Michelangelo was highly rated by both Trip Advisor and Cond√© Nast. So it helped with the decision. Upon arrival there were issues with my upgrade (prior guest caused the room to need extra work) but the manager met us in the lobby and explained and I wouldn't be charged for it. It was a disappointment because it was a high floor and would've helped with the noise but couldn't be helped by the hotel and I appreciate how it was communicated. That was Thursday afternoon- I don't recall his name. The room and hotel were nice. It was stately and opulent. It was also historic. As such there aren't the modern things that you'll get in the newer and more renovated hotels. But that also brings positives. It is big....we had a 2 bed studio - very spacious with a great bathroom and vanity area.....2 women- we had bags for days and it was great. The heavy curtains helped with street noise and lights. Great location- walking distance to many things - diners and theaters- and good and helpful staff rounded out the pros. There were a few cons....there are a few housekeeping items that could use better attention- literally...like dust and the carpets need replacing or deep cleaning. Room service is not 24/7- AM for Breakfast and PM until 11:30 for dinner, but once you know that and because of the city that's something to which one can easily adapt. Also the duvet was stained when we arrived but replaced (by one with a burn, but clean) and the extra security latch on the door did not work. But speaking of security, Michelangelo is \"on point.\" We ordered Door Dash late a couple of nights post theatre and they were not getting upstairs without a security escort. I loved it! I stand by my 4 star rating. There were more pros than cons and I think it's a solid 4 star hotel. I would recommend staying knowing that it has good sized rooms (my one was great), great location and good staff. Thank you for the rating and review. We are happy to hear that your stay was enjoyable and appreciate your recommendations. We are happy you chose us upon a multitude of hotels in the city. We apologize for the housekeeping and maintenancing not meeting expectations. We appreciate that you enjoyed the room otherwise along with the bathroom. We hope to see you back here again in the future. Have a wonderful day.",

      "content": "The location of this hotel speaks for itself; the lobby is attractive, the rooms clean, the bathrooms particularly comfortable with their generous bathtubs. Having been a regular visitor to this hotel for many years, though, I miss the old Michelangelo's attention to the needs of busy people in the city. The self-service continental breakfast, once included in the price of the room, was a great convenience that I miss. The \"facilities fee\" (renamed \"residence fee\" in more recent notices) now tacked onto each bill has taken its place! This appeared only in the small print of my original reservation, and I'm glad I read it before arriving at the hotel so that I could digest this unpleasant surprise in private. If not warned when making the reservation, be aware of this additional charge. (Wouldn't it make sense to include that fee in the room charge, since it is not optional?) Each room used to have a card listing services available from housekeeping, and upon arrival one was offered a choice of newspapers, to be left outside the door of the room. Now one needs to make special requests to receive the turn-down service or a newspaper. Be sure to ask for these if you want them, they are still available, even if not advertised! I hope these tips help visitors to this hotel make the most of its services, even as it shifts its attention away from the comfort of guests. Except for the front desk, the service at the hotel is still excellent. Those in charge should take an example from the housekeeping staff and doormen! Thank you for the review. We are happy to hear that your stay with us was comfortable and you are a returning guest. We apologize for the changes and take your suggestions into consideration. We appreciate you taking the time to inform us of a guest's perspective of our changes and we will strive to regain that form of hospitality you are referring to.

Extra shout out to the bartender Carmen. She was great. You cannot beat the location. It is one block from radio city. The couple we traveled with was very happy with their experience too. The next time I am in NYC, The Michaelangelo Hotel is the first hotel I will be calling. Thank you again for a fantastic stay. Dear Guest, Thanks for the wonderful review!

Cesar at the door and Carmen at the bar were warn and friendly. The room was nicely appointed but showing some age. It's not the most convenient situation for a gadget geek. I guess you could say that just adds to its charm. I choose this hotel because of its proximity to the Gershwin Theater. I know you can get anywhere in the city by bus, cab or subway but that's not what I wanted on this trip. Aside from the fact that it's in a very touristy part of town, it's just a short walk to find some good local spots. Pick a Bagel on 53rd and 8th is your best pick for breakfast. If 7th Ave is too crowded for you then just walk down one block to 6th and avoid the madness. Take a walk down seven blocks to The Long Room on 44th Street. Great Scottish/Irish pub. The food was great and atmosphere is awesome. Thank you for the stellar review, Pat! We're thrilled your time with us so wonderful!

Through iPrefer and Visa, we had a larger room with a full breakfast and the rate was less than a smaller room with no breakfast. When we arrived, the room was not ready and they said it would be about 10 to 15 minutes. No problem, not in a rush, so we walked about twenty five feet to a table in the lounge. The room was ready in about 15 minutes but we were having such a good time in the lounge, we just hung there for about an hour and a half. Thanks to Jimmy the Bartender, our trip started on a positive note. Room 710 which faced 7th Ave. These room are very spacious, clean, and just very comfortable. As for noise, well we slept with the window open. Window open or closed, you will hear an occasional siren and horn. This is New York City. Location. The Michelangelo is in the heart of the Tourist and Theater District. It's very nice to walk over to see a play but yet be able to catch the subway and go wherever you need to be. It's very crowded in this area but we are OK with it. Our breakfast was enjoyable, plenty of choices, no complaints. Overall review is that we like The Michelangelo. People like Henry, Jimmy the Bartender, Jimmy the Breakfast guy, and Carmen the Bartender, make this a very welcoming, comfortable and enjoyable stay. Thanks for the stunning review!

      "content": "After much research about which hotel to pick for our recent New York visit, we settled for The Michelangelo Hotel, and I could say that we couldn't have picked a better one! I was traveling with my husband and 2 kids aged 12 and 14, and we booked a room with 2 king-sized beds. The room was spacious, clean, & elegantly furnished. The hotel location is just perfect! The hotel is just a few blocks, easy walking distance to Time Square, but the entrance is just around the corner away from the hustle and bustle of it all. There is a caf√© just nearby (Caf√© Duke) where we bought cooked Chinese/Asian fusion food for lunch and dinner if we felt like eating in. There was also KFC, Pizza Hut, Nathan's & Tom Horton's at the back of the building, as well as other choices. We walked almost everywhere, and when we found it a little far, we could either take the nearby metro, or ask the doorman to hail a cab, or used uber. Surely, there were some things like having to pay for a beverage allowance of USD10 per room per day, but we just got free drinks from the bar to avail of our daily \"allowance\". There is no kettle and free coffee in the room but I go down to get coffee or tea at the bar and got to chat with the friendly bartenders who were always so courteous to all. The Michelangelo is a charming hotel. The location can't be beat, especially if you come to watch Broadway shows. We watched more than a few shows and the theaters were so close to our hotel! The staff were friendly and especially nice, and sincere in looking after our needs as well as kind to our children. We love the Michelangelo and we'll definitely come back!

Breakfast has superb choices. Cafe Duke is very close, so you can get room snacks and almost anything--Pizza station, cafeteria food, affordable. I think open 24 hours-huge! Walk to shows also a nice touch. For some reason, we rarely can find someone at the door when we are checking in. This means we need to drag suitcases down the few stairs at the entry way.

Then our numerous calls for room service went unanswered, I also left two messages for them which were not answered also. I did not mention this to the front desk at checkout so I can't say how they handled it, though I'm sure they would have attempted to rectify it had they been informed.

I've stayed here on multiple occasions (as its really close to my clients & office). Its right in the middle of the theatre district / Time Sq mid-town area, well-connected but because its away from Broadway, it is at least a little less frantic! Rooms are huge, well-equipped, comfortable and elegant. WiFi is good & reliable. Restaurant & bar area are fine (typical hotel food and definitely not a desination, but great for drink or a quick bite to eat if you can't be bothered to go out or don't want room service) Would definitely recommend for tourists as well as business travellers who want a central mid-town location Thanks for the 4-star rating and review, Joanne!

From the bellmen to the concierges everyone was very respectful, very warm and made us feel at home. The hotel is centrally located in mid town close to Broadway plays, Times Square, Central Park, and Rockefeller center. Be aware The daily residence fee, we used the business center and wifi daily. The only 2 less then perfect issues I had : 1) the bed was firm and comfortable but felt lop sided, peaked in the middle and sloped to the side. 2) the toilet. Very tight against the toilet paper holder. Not for large ( fluffy ) people like me. The bathroom overall was beautiful. My wife and I would definitely stay here again when the opportunity arises.

There were 3 of us in the room and it was just big enough. The beds were doubles instead of queens so it was a little tight sleeping arrangements but worked out fine. The staff is very helpful and accommodating. They were able to help us find food at midnight when we arrived late due to delayed flights.

Great housekeeping with turn down service and a different little treat left every evening. The hotel is ideally located for everything. A few blocks from the Empire State and Grand Central Station. Easy walk to Broadway and Times Square. I cannot recommend this hotel highly enough. The staff made our experience so special and really went the extra mile. Special mention to Troy for his great breakfast recommendations (Moonstruck on 38th and Madison) and for bringing us towels when we returned to the hotel in a torrential downpour.

Mr. Jason Sturtevant, the Senior Sales Manager personally wrote me a note to ask if there were any accommodations that I would like to have during my stay. I replied with my situation of working in NYC for a few weeks and that my new fianc√© would be joining me for the weekends. Jason, to my pleasant surprise took this heart and made my experience with my fianc√© at the Archer a dream come true. It made my entire stay extremely happy and comfortable, better than most because of the personal touch and genuine heart that thy have in every detail of the Hotel. From the first greet at the door to the bell hop, and the bar staff, the housekeepers and turn down services- everyone was absolutely friendly, caring, and accommodating. We received countless little reminders of just how special of guests we were to them in so far as hors d‚Äôoeuvres, champagne and surprise deliveries to the room with hand written notes and signatures- it was simply amazing! While I was in NYC for work it felt more like the entire stay was a mini honeymoon as it was so nice to be surrounded and comforted by a world class team of experts in hospitality. I have recommended the Archer Hotel in NYC to all of my numerous coworkers based in the US for their travels to the city where our firm's global headquarters are located. I envy the next opportunity to stay at the Archer Hotel in NYC, as it is the best hotel in the city and after traveling to and staying at five star hotels in LA, Paris and Miami recently- I'd take the Archer Hotel in NYC over every other place in the world.

Anyone who operates a hotel should observe the service that this hotel delivers. A warm welcome at the hotel but watchful eyes on incoming and outgoing guests - very important on these dangerous times. The housekeeping service came, replaced towels, made up truly comfortable beds without intruding. Having a donut is usually a great treat but one should not miss this delicious and fun splurge. (The leftover donuts are stored for every guest in case one cannot resist taking them home when they leave). There is also a comfortable seating patio at the entrance of the hotel. I cannot recommend this hotel highly enough. Thank you, Mrs. Claire Graham. We are delighted to hear you enjoyed many aspects of your stay with Archer, especially our sincere service and those decadent donuts from Charlie Palmer Steak.

The rooms were tastefully decorated with THE most comfortable beds, and my view of the Empire State Building from the 18th floor was gorgeous! Can't wait until my next trip to NYC! Thank you, Lee L.

The objective of the trip was to provide to my mother most probably her last international trip, due to her age and overall conditions. She worked in international offices and has been travelling worldwide for over 50 years. Her dream was to go to New York once again. When we arrived early the first impression was just perfect. The front desk attendance lady sensitivity was huge, and once it was possible, provided an early check in. The same happened in the check out. During the stay the concierge was very supporting in several occasions, including the reception of a wheel chair. The room services helped in latter hours to freshen the room with a nice and clean environment. Others as the restaurant, suitcase storage and outside door reception were always respectful and polity. Definitely a hotel in New York to stay . Will recommend always to friends, apart from the personnel, it‚Äôs in an excellent location, with great view and in my opinion with the right size, making it an experience, not only a stay.

I've been to the city many times as I used to live in the area. The location is a very convenient walk from several subway lines/stations. It is midway between 5th and 6th Avenues so noise wasn't an issue in the room, very quiet. We also felt safe in this neighborhood, no matter the time of day. Every staff member we met was friendly, courteous, and willing to go the extra mile to make our stay perfect. The room was efficiently NYC. In other words, very European. In more words...not roomy. Which was perfect for us, we were very comfortable with only two people, three people would not have fit. If you need a big hotel room, then you will need to pay an exorbitant price at another hotel or change the expectations, this is NYC. The bathroom had plenty of room and the shower was amazing. Housekeeping kept the room very clean and they were very helpful. Nice bonus: the room coffee was delicious! (it needs to be a headache emergency before I will touch room coffee). The second surprise bonus was finding a delicious sweet treat in the evening. Not the usual chalky gross square of chocolate, but a different good quality treat every night. Another notation on how the Archer is willing to go above the norm to please customers. We utilized the onsite restaurant only once, for brunch on Sunday. It was delicious and prices were parallel to other places of similar quality. All said and done, we had an amazing stay at the Archer and will definitely plan a return trip. Thanks!

However, the room size is unreal - but in the bad way. I am a frequent traveler and never (not even during past trips to NYC) have I stayed in such a tiny room. There was barely any space to move around, much less to put any suitcases. This was really disappointing and why I gave this hotel a 3 star. At the same price point there are lots of other centrally-located hotels available that have more decently sized rooms. For the unbelievably small room size, I would NOT recommend this hotel.

It's located on a side street and is a narrow small boutique hotel. The room was tiny! The king bed pretty much takes up the whole room. There's a desk, but it's filled with yummy treats they give you nightly and a tray of inexpensive snacks you can buy. The bathroom was conventional in size and very nice. I had no view since I got in past midnight, but I hear the upper floors can have a view. The hotel was pretty quiet and room service was good (ordered it twice for breakfast). The service at this hotel was outstanding. Whatever I wanted, they delivered. I asked for extra gourmet fortune cookies dipped in chocolate and sprinkles and they brought them up in a nice black bag that was labeled with a note on a silver tray. The room had very nice amenities, small touches here and there. I'm not sure I would stay here again if it were not just me though b/c I can't imagine being in that room with more than just me.

Great restaurants nearby (check out korean restaurants). Granted, the room was one of the tiniest I've been in, but it was super CLEAN, had every amenity I expect - MALIN & GOETZ toiletries, Nespresso machine, robes, and cute slippers. Great restaurants/bars onsite. And a huge plus - walk across the street to Culture Espresso - DELICIOUS LATTES AND WARM CHOCOLATE COOKIES! My other favorite in NY is Crosby Street, but their rates have become ridiculously out of touch. Archer's rates are def reasonable for what you get. I left my stay feeling like everything was absolutely lovely. Only thing keeping it from a 5 star would be a larger sized room. But definitely a gem and worthy of my repeat business!

Small armoire for hanging clothes, space under the bed for storing suitcases. If you have huge cases storage may be a problem. Bathroom and shower were great, comfy beds. Nespresso machine in room and nightly turn down service with a treat. Rooftop bar has lovely views of Empire State Building. Nice seating area but stiff drink prices. The bar was often booked for private events when we were there so guests were either segregated to certain parts of the bar or kicked out all together. Would have sucked if you didn't get to experience it. It's a nice hotel and I would recommend it. It's not super luxurious but a good option in central NYC. Thank you, jolliette.

For starters, property is very well-located, the rooms are spotless, and the linens and bed are first rate. But the little things move this past four stars, each done in a quality way: not just complimentary bottled water, complimentary FIJI water. Not just an umbrella in the closet, a stylish MoMA umbrella. Darling slippers that you may consider taking home. Malin & Goetz bath products. A reading light, a book. Free WiFi. The only negative is the room size. Mine was very small even by Manhattan standards. Believe the fellow at check-in; he's telling the truth. Thank you, LLfromNYC.

We were on a room only basis but lots of places around to have breakfast. We did try dinner one night in the hotel restaurant. Lovely food and great selection. Every night when we returned to our room there was a selection of Cookies or Chocolates which was a lovely touch. There is a roof top area but sadly we did not get to see it but by all accounts it is great for a few cocktails (no children allowed).

      "content": "This was one of the best weekends we've ever had in New York, and a good deal of the reason is the Archer Hotel. The hotel is beautiful, the service is impeccable, the restaurant and bars are fantastic, the views are spectacular and, though the rooms are \"cozy\" (aka, a bit on the small side) ours was absolutely stunning (exposed brick walls) with a beautiful (and nice sized) marble bathroom, a heavenly bed and an unmatched view of the Empire State Building. Plus, while still in midtown and within easy walking distance to Times Square and the Theater District, Penn Station, St. Patrick's, as well as other sites of interest, it's on a relatively quiet side street (for NYC), and there are plenty of delis, cafes, restaurants and bars in close proximity. Oh, and it was pretty affordable, especially for such a high-end boutique hotel in midtown Manhattan. Finally, though we did not dine at the restaurant (we did dine at another Charlie Palmer establishment), we very much enjoyed both the Foyer Bar and the Spyglass rooftop bar (where the views cannot be beat). The Foyer Bartender, Nicki, was very friendly and personable; and the rooftop bartender, Arel (sp?) was friendly, interesting and extremely talented, making us some out of this world cocktails, both new twists on classics and completely original creations. The Bar Manager and Sommelier, Amanda, also went out of her to be helpful and accommodating, and she was an absolute pleasure to converse with. Though I have pointed out these few people with whom we interacted most during our stay, I want to add that every single person we encountered at the Archer was friendly and professional, from the housekeepers to the bellman, concierge, front desk personnel, servers and even a couple of maintenance guys we ran into. We had a fantastic time, felt like we made new friends at the hotel and will go back again (and again and again). Thank you, Cruizin_Fool.

I spent a lot of time researching hotels in NYC, location, price etc. I narrowed it down to my top 3 and finally choosing The Archer Hotel. Before I we even checked in I contacted the hotel to see what their process was for having a bottle of champagne waiting in the room for when we arrived. They were so great on not only providing the champagne but a little mini chocolate cake with a card. So far so good. Location: Excellent! Walking distance to theatre without being right in all the madness of Times Square. Room: ‚Ä¢ Nice touch of complementary water (2 bottles) and caramel candy when you arrive in your room. ‚Ä¢ Most reviews noted how small the rooms were. They are right, the rooms are tiny but 2 of us were able to work it out. Not really a lot of space to place your clothes. The nightstand had drawers but they are very small. There is place to hang clothes and storage under the bed for your luggage. ‚Ä¢ The room was very clean and loved the high ceilings and one exposed brick wall ‚Ä¢ The bed was very comfortable and the bathroom was nice and clean and very modern looking ‚Ä¢ Turn down service nightly with a different treat left for you each night. ‚Ä¢ Our room had an almost perfect view of The Empire State Building. If you want a full view don‚Äôt book our room 1508 and save yourself the upgrade fee Extras: ‚Ä¢ Free Wi-Fi ‚Ä¢ Spyglass Rooftop Bar ‚Äì Excellent view of The Empire State Building, especially at night. ‚Ä¢ Charlie Palmer Steakhouse ‚Äì Dine one day here and it was very good. ‚Ä¢ Foyer Bar ‚Äì We sat outside in nice little lounge area on the hotel patio ‚Ä¢ Staff- Great Issues: (if I really had to find anything wrong) ‚Ä¢ Room 1508 shouldn‚Äôt be a full upgrade price due to half a view of The Empire State Building. They should let you know the view is somewhat obstructed. But then again how often are you looking out the window. Go the rooftop bar grab a drink and get the best view ever. ‚Ä¢ Room cleaning a little late in the day. I‚Äôve been in larger hotels and the rooms were done earlier in the afternoon. I was told by a not so friendly desk clerk that their policy is room cleaning service has until 6pm to be cleaned. Could have been told that without the attitude from the guy at the front desk. Bottom Line: Would I stay at The Archer Hotel again? YES. Give this little gem a try. My next trip I will definitely stay at The Archer again. They were great! Thank you, SWing63.

But the reception and Scotty in particular were patient and polite and even showed us another room which we actually declined. They were gracious, helpful and very friendly all of the time we were there. We loved the evening chocs and biscuits left by the evening houseperson when turning down the sheets. The beds were really comfy and good soundproof so you didn't hear any other guests.The location was perfect- just a few minutes from Times Square and all the shops and the bus tours. They even have a rooftop bar where at night you feel you are next to the Empire State Building. So all and all we will definitely stay there again when we revisit NY. Thank you, LittleMo15.

I was traveling alone for only an overnight stay. It is not possible to open a full size roller bag without putting it on top of the bed. There are amenities in the room but they take up what little space exists: between a Nespresso machine and a minibar tray on the desk, it's not possible to work. The nightstand is so small, you can't put anything on it because the hotel phone takes up the entire surface. It's not a dirty hotel, but it's not terribly clean either. I saw lots of debris on the 4th floor public corridor carpet (the rooms are also carpeted; it seem more sanitary and much nicer for newer hotels to have wood floors or hard floors). I would definitely not stay here again. The Refinery is two doors down and the rooms are much more spacious (the room rates there are probably a little higher, too). But worth it.

      "content": "You've read the reviews and you might be thinking, surely this is just hype, surely this hotel isn't that nice. Think again. It is all that and a bag of chips, my friend. Let me start first with the location. The hotel is on a quieter street in Midtown. You barely notice any of the city noise from the room but you are still close enough to subway stops and destinations. We walked everywhere without any issue. The hotel itself is thoughtfully designed. The elevators are so quiet you can barely detect them, even if your room happens to be right off the elevators (mine was and I thought it would be an issue. Boy was I wrong). The Spyglass bar is also a nice feature. We enjoyed a relatively decent drink with some killer views and excellent service. The views alone are worth the drink price. Now to the room features...The rooms are small, yes, but so thoughtfully designed that you find that don't mind the lack of space. They have engineered the rooms to take advantage of each square foot and have included so many thoughtful features. The sleeping space has a comfortable bed with both fluffy and flat pillows! Both for each person! The beds are flanked with mounted lights on dimmer switches, and can I tell you how much I appreciate proper dimmer switches on hotel lights?! There is a desk if you need to work and the desk chair hits well above its weight. The extra padding provides comfort without adding bulk and taking up too much space. You also have a Nespresso machine with proper espresso cups and coffee cups so you don't have to endure a hideous cup of coffee. Full length mirror on the external bathroom door and under the bed storage help to provide you with the extra features you need to get yourself ready for your time in NYC. The bathroom is actually quite large and I'm glad they didn't skimp on the space here. Two people can easily get ready in that space. I also want to take a moment to mention the Malin+Goetz toiletries. I love this company and it was a serious bonus to know I wouldn't have to bring my own toiletries. They also provide thoughtful touches such as welcome treats, turn down service (with its own treats!), large umbrellas for you to use while you are there, and slippers to keep. For me though, the best part of the Archer is its killer staff. These hospitality specialists gave this hotel the 5 star ranking. There are many hotels that offer the kinds of features that you find at the Archer but few compare to its customer service. You are met right away by a friendly staff member who is quick to offer a greeting and assistance and every other person you meet is on that same level of quality. They are friendly, informative, and happy to meet any request you may have. We were celebrating a birthday and I asked if there was anything they could do to help make the evening memorable and they came through with a birthday cake and sparkling wine in-room amenity. It was great! Their attention to detail was everywhere. When we needed extra toiletries they were brought up in a themed black bag. When we were checking out they immediately asked if we needed luggage storage and transportation without any prompting. They also offered up some water bottles when we returned from a day of exploring. They anticipate your needs and meet them before you are even aware that you have a need. To me, that sets this hotel apart from the numerous other available options. If you have a chance, stay at this hotel. You won't regret it. Thank you for your thoughtful review, 716mdr.

We had a voucher for the wine anyway.) - The room was lovely - we were in a double double room. Really pleased with shower size. Overall, a small room, but they all are in the city for the most part. They used the space well - a sliding door for the bathroom saves a lot of room. Would have liked a bit more lighting - in particular when you move the bathroom door, the mirror on the outside ends up in too dark an area to really see if you're doing makeup in that mirror. - Beds were comfortable, linens cozy, and decor was nice. - Complimentary caramels and chocolate are a nice touch.

A comfortable bed, large tiled shower, big windows, a safe, microwave, refrigerator, and Keurig coffee maker. They offered bottled water upon check-in and check-out. I was worried about the noise from the traffic, but barely heard a sound. The closet was tiny, but there's plenty of space in the dresser drawer and bedside tables. My room.had a view of the Empire State Building.",

      "content": "I've been to NYC several times before, but this was my first stay at this HGI. From the time we checked in until the time we left, everything was flawless! The room was a little smaller than what I've had near Times Square, but we weren't there but to sleep. The front desk staff went above and beyond and were friendly at check in and check out. The concierge (female) made it a point to tell us to have a nice day every time we walked out and welcomed us back on our return each and every time. The breakfast staff (all of them were great), but especially Chef Luis and our server Jakiya were fantastic! They chef remembered our omelette order every single morning after the first day and Jakiya remembered our drink order every single morning after day one as well. I'd definitely recommend this property to anyone traveling to NYC and I will likely return here on my next visit. If you're coming into Penn Station, this hotel is ideal as its only a block or two away and easy walking. Its also conveniently located right next to Macy's at Herald Square and only about a 5-10 minute walk to the center of Times Square! Thanks for a great trip! Thank you for the outstanding review, Casey! We're delighted your experience with us was so wonderful! It's fantastic our team could accommodate your needs and assist you in any way possible. We aim to please and your praise lets us know we're doing our job! We're thrilled you appreciated our top-notch location as well!

It was larger than I had expected after seeing all of the reviews that stated the small size of New York City hotel rooms. The cleanliness and the comfort of the room was excellent. Our city-view looked upon the Empire State Building was incredible. Access to the subway system was only about 150 feet from the entry. We interacted with a number of different staff members. Every time our experience was excellent which to me indicates that it is well managed and run. We would definitely stay here again when we return to New York City.",

There is no way to get to any floors above the lobby except by using the elevator which resulted in lines. I don't recommend. We appreciate the feedback, Kirk. We're disappointed your time with us was less than ideal. We regret the inconvenience caused by our renovations and that our accommodations and services didn't meet your expectations.

All other sites and areas of NYC can easily be reached via subway since there is an entrance to the 34th St-Herald Square stop steps away from the entrance. Penn station is only a short walk away for any lines not serviced by those at the Herald Square stop. The hotel is so central I would return to the hotel to take mid-day sightseeing breaks without skipping a beat. The hotel room itself was clean and comfortable, and the staff friendly and helpful. Without request, I was even given a room with a view of the Empire State Building. Highly recommended! Dear Guest, Thanks for the wonderful review!

I was a long time NYC resident and had to leave the city for health issues. Needless to say, I have to come back in for medical reasons and try to bunch them together. So, I find myself staying over and it's easy to leave my suitcase on the last day at a hotel just a few blocks from Amtrak. The first person to check me in more than a year ago was Janis at the front desk. She was effervescent, eager to help and so funny. I knew immediately I had found a hotel where I'd feel at home. Janis also gave me a coupon to use at Macy's which was fabulous! Every time since has been nothing but professional and always so welcoming and helpful. They were also extremely respectful my last stay when I requested complete privacy for an entire day to recover from a medical procedure. They only offered anything they could do. I know many stay here because of it's proximity to transportation but the folks inside treat guests like they've arrived at a special place. Thank you for the outstanding review, Dawn!

      "content": "I had a Hilton rewards giftcard, and I was having a hard time redeeming it using the online system. I called Hilton customer service and made the reservation over the phone. The customer service agent told me to present my giftcard upon check-in at the hotel, and I would be issued a refund to the credit card I used to book. When we arrived at the hotel, we explained the giftcard situation. The desk agent informed us that we would have to ask tomorrow about the giftcard. We asked a different desk agent the next day, who told us submitting the giftcard for a refund would be no problem (echoing what we'd been told on the phone by customer service), but we would have to do it upon checkout. At checkout we spoke with the same desk agent who had checked us in-- Elizabeth Akisanya-- who (now that she could no longer pass the buck) said there was no way that she could honor customer service's promise that we could have the giftcard value refunded to our credit card. She refused to contact her manager, and quite rudely told us there was nothing more she could do. We feel entirely scammed, and we have wasted hours on the phone and in person arguing and being given the run-around just to redeem our giftcard. We still have not been able to successfully redeem it. The hotel is itself was not worth the steep price (especially given the fact that neither wifi nor the TV remote worked in our room)-- but with the rude service we received, I wouldn't stay there again even if it was free. There are hundreds of better hotel options in the area, where you can expect to be treated like a guest. Avoid this hotel at all costs. We appreciate the feedback, Cait. We're disappointed that your time with us was less than ideal. However, it's simply not possible for any facilities or hotels to authorize one card and put the authorization back to a different card. There was also no charge processed during your stay, so we unfortunately could not refund any transactions that didn't exist. Hopefully this explains the situation. Have a great day.",

This year we decided to stay away from the chaos and look for somewhere a little \"quieter\", yet still close enough to walk to a Broadway show. This is the SPOT! Not nearly as crazy and busy as Times Square but only a 10 minute walk away. The subway is literally just steps away from the front door. That alone is a plus when it comes to getting around the city. The hotel staff was friendly and helpful. There was usually someone in the lobby to greet us as we came and went. They offered bottles of water at check-in and check-out. I haven't been offered that at more expensive hotels in the city. The complimentary coffee, variety of teas and hot chocolate that are served in the lobby in the morning is nice. (There was a Keurig in the room but I couldn't get it to work) The coffee was that good that I didn't even think of visiting a local coffee shop. There were only a couple of issues. The elevators are some of the smallest I've seen in a hotel. 4 people and their bags will just about fill the elevator. Due to their small size there were a few times that we had to wait longer than normal to get on. On multiple trips down, as we'd stop at a floor, people weren't able to get on due to the elevator being full. The bigger issue was the size of the beds. Our room had 2 double beds. Now they were comfortable and I can say I slept well but be aware that you'll be crammed and maybe a little uncomfortable depending on you sleeping arrangements. The overall size of the room was smaller than some other rooms in NYC but I'm going to presume there are smaller ones. All being said, we did enjoy our stay and would definitely stay again. I'd actually probably look at this hotel first when planning my next trip to NYC. Dear Guest, Thank you for the 4-star rating! We're thrilled your time with us so wonderful.

      "title": "Beyond excellent service, but the rest needs improvement (not on par for Hilton)",
      "user": "emory95",
      "content": "I always choose Hilton and one other major hotel brand because of the typical cleanliness and service I receive at each. I've stayed in many Hilton properties and am an Honors member. The below is based solely from a Hilton perspective. SERVICE: Front-desk service was as good, if not better than, the Ritz Carlton! I can't say enough about how courteous and helpful they and concierge were. ROOMS: The rooms have been recently renovated and are quite nice, but we had issues (all reported to front desk and the service/repair happened immediately): 1) the safe wouldn't work so it was replaced; 2) the fridge wasn't cooling so maintenance had to work on that too; and 3) the closest ice maker wasn't working so I took my bucket to the front desk and the staff filled it for me while I waited. It seems a quality-control checks and balances should be in place for these pieces of equipment. BREAKFAST: Price was included in our room rate (highly recommend because it equated to less than 25% of the per person cost). One of the servers was excellent and the rest were a little slow on their feet-- they are only setting the tables and taking beverage orders; rest is self serve. One morning a non-U.S. native guest decided to help himself to the veggies, etc. on the omelet station. Only the omelet chef is to access these. I could tell the omelet chef was extremely frustrated so I finally said to the female, \"he's not supposed to be doing that.\" She spoke English and stopped him in their native tongue. I then explained to her it was not sanitary. Hotel management needs to place a sign over that area that says hotel guests should ask if they want any items from behind the glass (and this would be a good idea in ALL of the Hilton properties with an omelet station). I do not eat pork/bacon for health reasons and would have liked a healthier option (turkey bacon or chicken link sausage) on the breakfast buffet. Management should investigate this too. HOUSEKEEPING: I did not report these as I could bear it, but think Hilton needs to visit this. I believe all NYC hotels outsource the laundry because of space, so I'm not sure if the provider is a Hilton company or not. The comforter cover had a stain on it that appeared to have been laundered and dried in. Housekeeping should inspect these with each room change and replace when needed. My sheets had two small blood stains, that also appeared to have been laundered and dried in (my sheets did get changed midpoint of our 6-day stay with no further issues); and one of the hand towels had similar stain (so I just pulled it and replaced it with a clean one from the extras in the shower). CAR SERVICE: DO NOT USE IT!!! The front-desk staff informed us of a car service (and clearly noted it was NOT a Hilton company). The rate the staff quoted was competitive with Uber. I was told the driver would arrive and wait for us. I made the reservation the day before departure; checked the morning of departure to ensure it was reserved for 6pm pick up; and at 6pm no car service! The luggage captain called to check on it and the car arrived at 6:15pm. Luckily I always allow for schedule hiccups, but I would have assumed since it was a private service that the driver would have been EARLY rather than late. The front desk told me that the service prefers cash, but credit cards are accepted with an additional $2 fee (makes sense because of the credit card service fee). Once the driver got us to the airport I pulled out my credit card, he went into this long discourse that he wanted cash, that there was a $5 surcharge (well in excess of even a 5% credit card fee based on the fare), and that he would have to pay taxes if I used the credit card. HMM . . . that's a huge red flag for a \"cash only, tax-evading business.\" I felt like I was in a \"gypsy cab\" from the 1990s (which actually happened to me the first time I traveled to NYC on business). I don't think Hilton should be doing business with this company and I highly recommend taking Uber-- we took it from the airport which was a lifesaver (over 2 hours from LGA to hotel due to Queens tunnel construction). If we'd taken a NYC yellow taxi to our hotel I bet our fare would've been over $200. So, although the hotel service was great, this particular Hilton hotel needs somes improvement. Dear Guest, We appreciate the feedback. We're happy you had a pleasant experience with us. It's lovely our team took such great care of you and assisted you in any way. However, we're disappointed your time with us was less than perfect. We strive to offer quality service and convenience for our guests.

That meant a lot to us, as my girlfriend was celebrating her birthday and we were both toasting to several significant milestones in our lives. We both recognize superior service because we have been in sales our whole lives, and we pay close attention to customer relations and service. We know the Hilton chain is a reputable chain, and you have proven your commitment to excellence with your attention to detail and superior team. WOW. Impressive! Amy, Jakira, Mohammed, and Luis were all fantastic!! We felt right at home and cannot wait to return.

It is not often that we receive ‚Äúred carpet‚Äù treatment, and we wanted to acknowledge the wonderful job you all did to make our trip superior to other trips to NYC.

      "content": "I wish there was a rating for 3-4 stars. My daughter and I stayed here for 3 nights/4 days for a mother and daughter trip early April. We first booked a room at Hilton at Times square but wanted to do some shopping and thought this location was better since it was so close to shops including Macy's and Korean town and walking distance to Penn station since we arrived by bus from Northern Virginia. Though we are Hilton members and we had chosen our room the day before when we arrived, the room was not ready.We were 2 hours early so they gave us another room, on a lower floor (22nd). I was worried about noise level but it wasn't bad throughout our stay. We did have neighbors on the first day but once they checked out it was quiet. Our room was typical NYC room-small but clean and perfect for our stay. We had the view of the empire state building. Please note that this hotel is very tall and narrow. Each floor only has few rooms therefore, you will be close to elevators. Our housekeeper was friendly and room was cleaned before we returned during mid-afternoon. We did the breakfast buffet which we included in our stay and from the person who made the omelet and our waitress had a smile. But if you didn't have a breakfast plan included in the cost of the room, there are plenty of places to eat especially 2 blocks around in Korean Time. Yummy bakeries...try Tous Les Jour. The only thing negative thing was the elevator...it was so slow and one day one of the elevators did not work so it took a long time but we were alright with it.Btw, the elevators are so small. Never been in a elevator that small. We did watch a show Wicked and that was fabulous. The subway is just around the corner so the location is perfect. I was trying to figure out something that was missing from this hotel and couldn't pinpoint it till half way through our stay. It was the attitude of the front desk. It wasn't that they were not helpful. They were quite expressionless and lacked the friendly smile that Hilton usually has. When I asked questions about late check out to where things were, it was quite matter of fact. I stopped asking questions after the first day because they seem unapproachable. When I was in the lobby on the last day, we spend 3 hours there trying to kill time and I observed the interactions of the front desk with customers. What I noticed was that with some people they were quite friendly and with others, they responded with a matter of fact. Needs improvement in this area. A friendly smile and eye contact is all they need to do with all people! Overall, it was a good stay because the service at breakfast and housekeeping covered what the front desk lacked and the location was ideal. Dear Guest, we appreciate your feedback. We strive to offer our guests quality service and comfort. However, we regret that your stay with us didn't exceed your expectations.

      "content": "I stayed here for my birthday May 2017. It was a girls trip and luckily it was just 2 of us. Our room had 2 queen beds that were very comfortable, but the room is not that big. With luggage walking space is limited so I wouldn't recommend for families. The room and bathroom was clean. The location is great close to Times Square, but far away from the craziness of it when you're ready to rest. Subway station is steps away from the door. Concierge was helpful. Secruity kept our luggage at check-in until our room was ready or whenever we came back to retrieve it because we were out and about past check-in time which is 3p so that was a plus. Secruity was also, helpful in hailing us cabs in the evening when we were going out. They offered a car service to the LaGuardia airport for a flat fee of $58.00 at check out which was nice, except for the driver charged us $63.00 instead. I informed the hotel and I am suppose to be compensated with HHonors points for the mistake of the driver. I am still waiting to verify because the HHonors website has been down. Overall I had a great stay and would definitely stay there again. Thanks for the 4/5 review, Sharonda! We're thrilled to hear that you had a great stay with us! It's wonderful that you enjoyed our location and proximity to Times Square and the subway station! We're also very pleased that our team provided you with helpful service!

One and a half blocks from Herald Square for easy Subway access. Same distance to The Empire State Bldg. There are so many hotels to choose from in this area. If you are a Hilton Honors member and want to be close to everything but still be able to shut the city out to get some sleep I highly recommend this Hilton.

Ryan was extremely helpful with all the paperwork, including assigning wonderful corner rooms for both reservations. He also made sure we were pleased once we had checked in. In addition, Tony, Tamika, Janice and Alex at the front desk were always cheerful and nice to speak with. Breakfast offerings were excellent, good quality and Luis making omelets, any kind of eggs you wish, was very friendly and always greeting us smiling each morning. The room, 3003, was recently renovated and was a corner room with an amazing view of the Empire State Building. Housekeepers were very friendly, even noting extra coffees and condiments to be left each day for us. The subway station literally at the foot of the building was a great convenience. It's not wonder the reviews are so good - they're very, very well deserved! They sold me on staying here for the first time, and it certainly will not be the last, as I hope to return every time I'm in NYC in the future! Thanks for such a wonderful stay, all of you!

Loved the location of the hotel - perfect between 5th and 6th avenue beside Macy's. Close to everything you would want to visit Time Square, Central Park, shopping etc. Best ever room I had in New York - it was much bigger than expected with a super sized comfortable bed and a really decent sized bathroom with a great roomy power shower . Coffee maker - fridge and microwave in the room along with a wardrobe plus room to park the suitcases out of the way were all a welcome bonus given the fantastic location. Although we were on the 8th floor with a street view, we never heard any street noise which amazed us. Complimentary coffee at reception in the mornings was such a welcome bonus along with cold iced water and cookies in the afternoon . Check in was perfect, room cleaning was perfect and we enjoyed a lovely hot breakfast on one of the mornings with eggs cooked to order. We received a very thoughtful personal note and complimentary bottle of wine to mark our wedding anniversary. Will also have to mention Sean in the rather compact bar who was very hospitable and friendly . If you are looking for the perfect base to explore New York look no further and you will not be disappointed. Thank you Hilton Garden Inn for making our trip a great one, keep up the good work and looking forward to staying with you again. Lorna Thank you for the fantastic review, Sandy!

      "content": "I was travelling for biz again when I needed to find a hotel that was in mid-town but not too expensive. I found this property and gave it a try. I'm glad I did. The hotel is tall and skinny--maybe 8 rooms per floor but 30+ floors. As typical for NYC rooms were smaller than what I get in other cities, but I found this room to be more than enough for my needs. I was provided a high-room floor. Let me say the elevators are FAST! No long rides or waits. The room was nice and clean and very comfortable. The Bath room was clean, had all I needed and I enjoyed it. The breakfast was basic--my expectations for hotel bfast is realistic, so I found this hotel's offer better than I expected. Service was quick enough and the food was pretty good (omlette bar)! I would certainly stay here again. Its close to the Empire State Building and right next to a subway stop if I had needed to move up/down town. Good hotel! Thank you for the 4-star rating, Steve! We're thrilled you had such a wonderful experience with us! It's excellent you enjoyed our comfortable rooms and prime location. We strive to offer top-notch service and convenience for our guests.

From our greeting at the entrance to our final goodbye, the staff were wonderful. My only complaint would be that, through the luck of the draw, we were picked as \"guests of the day.\" We had a choice of prizes and chose free breakfast the next morning. The dining room was very nice and the staff great. However, the buffet wasn't that great and it was $19.95 per person. I would have been upset to pay that much for that breakfast. It wasn't any better than some hotels put out for free. Dear Guest, thank you for the fantastic rating! We're delighted to hear you had a great stay with us and enjoyed our location!

      "content": "We stayed at the Garden Inn for six days during mid April 2017. It was our first trip with our baby (8 months old at the time). We looked at different hotels around the area and this one seemed like the most baby-friendly. We were right. Our room was located next to the elevators but we didn't hear a single thing. We had really noisy neighbors (if you stepped out into the hallway you could hear them fighting) but the sounds were muffled inside the room. The crib provided by the hotel was comfortable enough. Our baby slept, well, like a baby the entire time we were there. The shower and tub were also good for her baths. Good water pressure, water warmed up in seconds. No problem there either. We didn't have breakfast at the hotel because of the hotel's location: we found it better to just walk outside and eat at one of the many, many restaurants nearby. (Props to Best Bagel and Coffee, two blocks away. Amazing bagels.) And that's another great thing about the Garden Inn. It's near enough to Times Square to be smack-dab in the middle of NYC but without all the noise and crowds. It also has a subway entrance right in the same block and uptown buses run about three blocks away. (The special bus to the Bronx Zoo, where we took our little one, leaves from Madison and 29th, a five-minute walk.) Wifi has three options, one free and two for high-speed internet (movies, Netflix, etc.). We went with the free version and it worked just fine. Staff was really friendly and accommodating. Laundry was fast and clothes came back great. (I'd like to make a special mention of the gentleman who runs the baggage deposit. Didn't catch his name but he was incredibly friendly.) All in all, a great hotel if you have a regular budget and are traveling with kids. We'll definitely stay here when we return to the Big Apple. Thanks for the 5/5 review, Esteban! We're delighted to hear that you had an excellent stay with us! It's wonderful that you loved our central location and proximity to Times Square!

Little street noise but street was blocked off for some reason right in front of the hotel so I lucked out! Room was nicely furnished with more than enough outlets for iPhones and laptops. You can manipulate the light fixtures from both the night stand and foyer. Bath was small but much nicer than the Hilton across the street and having stayed at both I would opt for the Warwick New York, I checked in early and was given a key to the room! This has never happened to me during my many NY visits. The only negative I have about this hotel is the Randolph Bar-Bistro. Pouring down rain kept me in the hotel Saturday afternoon and I ate there. Service was beyond Slow for both my lunch. The kitchen is located downstairs. Waitress was apologetic but only after I had complained. I would NOT recommend this place to eat; I spent too much for what I had: iced tea (no free refill), burger, fries and chocolate cake - to be fair they were good but not at these prices.",

We were able to get a great rate on Expedia. From looking at the website and previous reviews, I knew it was going to be great. The location was also a deciding factor. You really are in the middle of everything at this hotel. We walked everywhere easily. The hotel exceeded any expectations I had. The Door men and Front Desk staff were very kind and professional. The staff at Randolph's Bar were amazing. They were friendly and funny and made us feel like this was our Bar. We met several travelers there that told us they only stay at The Warwick when they come in to the city. Our room was very large, and well appointed. We had a city view room overlooking 6th avenue. The room was quiet and comfortable with very nice bedding and a marble bathroom. I highly recommend putting the Warwick on the top of your list when considering a hotel in the city.

Most of them for business, when it didn't matter too much what the window looked out onto since I was just going to be going back and forth to the office (on 6th Ave so VERY convenient). My most recent visit was for fun with friends. While we had a nice suite and could host a pre-dinner glass of wine, the windows all faced other buildings or brick walls. The good news is that Central Park is very close, as is the MOMA (across the street). If you hope to look out your window and watch the city or the skyline this hotel has limited options. With that in mind, the location is fabulous and the service very good. Thank you kindly for your loyalty to the Warwick!

Our room was maybe slightly larger than one typically finds in NYC, although it would not be construed as particularly large. The bed was comfortable and the amenities were good. Staff was friendly and efficient all throughout the hotel. There is a restaurant on site, but we ate elsewhere our entire stay so I have no comments about that. Checkout was a breeze and they were very helpful in storing our bags until the time came for us to head to the airport. I would highly recommend this hotel!

I made them aware when I booked it months prior, followed up with a phone call the day before arrival and told them again when we checked in because they ASKED if we were celebrating anything special ... not a drink, not a rose or a box of chocolates not even a card ... we even upgraded to a suite but sadly they did nothing ... such a classy hotel acted very pedestrian about something that was a really big deal to us ....

The staff is friendly and helpful. I want to mention a few for accolades. I arrived on the evening of May 4th after a challenging travel day, and was greeted by Vilma at the front desk. Vilma was impressive - professional, helpful and friendly. She made for a smooth, expeditious check in, and assigned me (and my adult daughter who was to arrive later) a lovely suite with a view of 54th Street and Sixth Avenue. A few days before our arrival, an email arrived from Mr. Louis Vanheusden welcoming us to The Warwick and providing useful information for our visit. The day after our arrival, we found a plate of fruit with a welcoming note from Mr. Vanheusden. These touches made a difference and distinguish The Warwick. And the Concierge, Kevin proved to be an invaluable and essential asset to a wonderful stay! He is an example of someone who excels in his profession. I was grateful for his expertise, advice, and help. (BTW, I recommend the New York Times column on ‚ÄúHow to Best Use Your Hotel Concierge,‚Äù May 28, 2017 Travel Section to TripAdvisor readers.). Sam, the Doorman, was unrelenting persistent in getting us a cab to the United Nations at a particularly busy time. Jes√∫s, the Bellman, was cheerful and helpful. Murals on 54, the hotel's breakfast restaurant, has buffet choices that were expansive, attractively arranged, and flavorful. Randolph‚Äôs Bar and Lounge is the perfect place to relax with a drink and food. Housekeeping excelled in maintaining the room and the property.

Our 24th-floor room had a king bed and access to a patio (which we didn't use, cf. toddler), and was quite spacious by NYC standards. Easily fit a rollaway twin bed. The extra bed and mini fridge required additional fees. Big windows, good light, decent a/c, which was great because we visited during a heat wave. We wanted to be close to Central Park and other amenities; this fit the bill, being just a few blocks south. Nearby were lots of coffee places, bakeries (Maison Kayser), convenience stores etc, the Plaza Food Hall was an upmarket but nice option to have, of course lots of restaurants at every turn. Service was prompt and friendly, decor was old-fashioned and charming. Carpets were a little old and slightly grungy, could use a refresh. Didn't get to use the gym or eat/drink in house, but maybe next time? All in all, a positive experience considering the challenges of visiting the Big Apple with an active toddler!

      "content": "If our readers bother to check our reviews, they will see that we have - more or less- stayed in every Midtown Manhattan hotel, including the five stars ones, and the most recent experience received at Warwick is one of the best. Yes, some parts of the hotel are not that brand new, certain things perhaps require renovation, but the characteristic charm of the old glorious days of NYC makes Warwick one of the most authentic and best hotels in the city. The check-in process was exemplary good; though we arrived before 11 AM and were ready to leave our luggage and hit the city, we were courteously given our room, and that is more than 4 hours earlier than the official check-in time (3 PM). Our room (#1410) was tucked away from the elevators area, the overall soundproofing was very good. The almost unobstructed view to 6th Ave was also a nice surprise, that is, compared to the most of Manhattan Midtown hotels. The room amenities were all there, from the fully stocked mini-bar and selection of snacks to the decent size TV, nice toiletries by London's Gilchrist & Soames, adequate number of electrical outlets for charging personal electronic devices (behind the night tables, certain inconvenience but not the terrible one). The bathroom is smallish, with one person - excuse the details - seated on the toilet, it is almost impossible to open the door, but the shower stall, inlaid with marble, was of a good size. The bed, its comfort, and the sleep quality were all very good. Even though the window gave on the bustle and hassle of 6th Ave the noise never felt like a problem. A huge advantage is the separate closet and luggage room, quite spacious, that would accommodate even some serious amount of one's suitcases. The elevators are rather small, which results in some waiting time in the peak hours, but nothing too annoying. The basic WiFi is free, the registration process is easy (doesn't require multiple screens) and works fine. The hotel is a home to Randolph's Bar & Lounge, proudly named after William Randolph Hearst, and Murals at 54, serving both a la carte and buffet breakfast. We have been to the latter before and just for the purpose of admiring the wonderfully restored murals by the popular American illustrator Dean Cornwell, commissioned by for the hotel's original owner, media magnate William Randolph Hearst, it is worth your while to stay at Warwick. Very satisfying experience. Highly recommended. Thank you very much for the kind and detailed comments following your recent stay with us.

On the down side: I would not recommend the room service, I had a Caesar , expensive for an ok quality no more (85 $ for the salad , a beer and a slice of cheese cake..). Service was good (I appreciated the rapid and dilligent check in and check out).",

This was the best option we could find, at a reasonable price compared to other hotels in the area. The location is really ideal, only five blocks from the park, and near many restaurants and sights (e.g. Rockefeller Center, Fifth Avenue, the Plaza, Central Park Zoo, Times Square, etc.). Particularly for families with small children, the location near the park is terrific. Hotel itself is quite comfortable. More of a classic New York hotel, older, but well-kept. Small lobby, and not very flashy, but understated and quite nice. We had a pretty large room for New York, with a terrace and seating outside on the terrace. Room was spacious and clean. Bathroom was a bit small, but perfectly serviceable. Bed was comfortable, and everything was laid out in a convenient manner. Service was quite good throughout. Front desk was responsive, and housekeeping was quite good. All of the employees we encountered were very friendly and nice, particularly the doormen. If you decide to book a room, definitely join their club, as you can get a discount and also free wifi. All in all, we were very happy with our stay and would stay here again.",

Our daughter just finished her first year of college in NY. We visited her 3-4 times this year. On one visit we stayed at another hotel closer to her college; however, we were terribly disappointed, We will never do that again. We love the charm of the Warwick, and the fact that all rooms are close to the elevators. The staff is very friendly and helpful. The Warwick is within walking distance to museums, restaurants, Central Park, Time Square, Rockefeller Center and the subway. It's always a pleasant surprise to have the doorman welcome us by name upon our arrival. The staff in Randolphs Lounge also greet us by name as soon as we walk in and remember our favorite meals and drinks. Some of the rooms can be small; however, since we joined the Warwick Journeys Program, we have been upgraded and stayed in more spacious rooms. The rooms are always clean, and housekeeping is prompt and efficient. The beds are very comfortable. The staff at the front desk are always helpful and friendly. We recommend the Warwick to all our family and friends, and they are never disappointed. Thank you very much for being one of our many loyal guests over the years and for taking the time to share some of your thoughts on Trip Advisor. The team and I were thrilled to read that you have found a home in New York and we hope to continue to welcome you back for many future visits.

For over 25 years, I always stayed at the same 5 star hotel in Midtown. This winter, a friend highly recommended the Warwick for a change of scenery. My friend was 100% right- the Warwick provided 5 star service and facilities for a more reasonable price than the place I had been staying. I stayed in a suite which was not only enormous but beautifully furnished and immaculately kept (with great views of 6th Ave). The staff, from the front desk to housekeeping, treated everyone like they were the most important guest staying there. Randolph's Lounge was a wonderful surprise as well. The vibe was very comfortable yet upscale. The staff were all friendly and attentive. The location is very central whether you are a \"tourist\" or someone familiar with the city who just needs quick access to the MTA and favorite stores (5th Avenue is one block away!). Long story short, the Warwick is now my hotel of choice in NYC. I just wish I had discovered it sooner. Thank you for your glowing review following your first visit to the Warwick.

It was also close to Times Square, and we felt perfectly safe walking back after a Broadway show. We booked a City View King for 3 nights. Check in was smooth despite a significant flight delay (we had an unexpected late arrival at 3:30 AM). The room was spacious and clean and the bed and linens were very comfortable. We were concerned about noise because it was on the 3rd floor, directly over the entrance on 54th Avenue and adjacent to the fitness center, but we found it to be extremely quiet during our entire stay. The \"view\" was of the rooftop over the entrance, but if you craned your neck just-so you could catch a glimpse of 6th Avenue. Since we spent most of our time out of the room this didn't bother us. The bathroom was nice, a little small, and didn't have a lot of counter space. Only one robe was provided, and the second one we asked for never arrived. We were disappointed there wasn't a coffee maker in the room. When we realized this at 4:00 AM there was nothing we could do about it. We also didn't have time for a full breakfast in the hotel restaurant before we had to be on the Upper West Side, so that made our first morning a bit foggy. But thankfully, with a quick call to housekeeping, a coffee maker was sitting in our room when we returned that evening. We kept meaning to check out the hotel bar for a late night drink, but being on West Coast time we never managed to get back before the12:30 closing. The facade, entrance and lobby of this grand old hotel are so charming. The room exceeded our expectations. And we loved the location. Overall this was an excellent base for our time in NYC.

This hotel truly has an eloquent past! Thank you for visiting our bar and lounge, Randolph's, and for taking the time to comment on our hotel's rich history.

I picked the Warwick this time for it's proximity to Carnegie Hall and was very pleased with the rate. When I arrived I was told that my room had been upgraded and had a lovely room with a view on the 21st Floor. The Room was spotless and very comfortable and well lit and the bathroom was huge. Had lunch with a friend at Randolph's and the food was delicious, would highly recommend the Quiche. The next morning had breakfast at Murals and it was exceptional most especially the variety and the fresh fruit, pricey but well worth it. Checked out at Noon and asked directions to the Westside Highway and the desk clerk told me that I could go to the garage and exit on 53rd street and go directly there, and when I said I couldn't manage that because of my luggage, the Bellman offered to take it across to the garage. The Warwick is an exceptional hotel, very comfortable and elegant with an absolutely excellent and friendly staff. My room was #2221. I can't wait for my next visit to New York City and a stay at the Warwick. Thank you for visiting us after some time and for the 5 star review online.

The reservationist was very sympathetic and went out of his way to ensure that we were accommodated at the same rate. The room was fine. It is an old hotel with period decor but clean and classic. The bathroom was shocking. I have seen bigger bathrooms on cruise ships. It was very awkward and tiny. We had drinks in the hotel bar before dinner. Outrageously expensive! The buffet breakfast which was included was very nice, exotic fruits, meats, perfect scrambled eggs and juicy english sausage. We did not actually check out since we had our bill so I forgot to inquire about the $25.00 facility fee. What the heck is that? Also, there was a charge for wi-fi. I refuse to pay for wi-fi and really hate hotels that do this. Thank you for your glowing review and Happy Belated Anniversary!

We left our rooms immediately after check-in to make it to a performance we were attending and did not realize the mistake until we returned from dinner, at which point we did not wish to change rooms. When we notified the front desk staff of the mix up during check out, we were treated with an accusatory tone and told that we must have requested rooms on the same floor (we did not) and that was why we did not receive the room we had booked. The price difference was refunded but there was no apology or attempt to make up for the error at check-in I expected more from the Warwick than an accusatory attitude following an error by the hotel staff at arrival and check-in.

You can't beat the location, no matter which attractions you want to visit in NYC--it's centrally located so you can get anywhere in the city relatively easily. It is a smaller hotel (I like this) and our room was a King bed which had a street view. We were surprised by how large the room was for NYC. Both the bed and bath were super clean, room service was prompt and friendly-- all good. My only complaint with the Warwick was there are no in-room coffee makers. As is the case with most room service fees in most major cities, the food and beverage were very over-priced, but there are multiple coffee chops nearby if you need morning coffee. I only wish we wouldn't have had to leave the hotel to get our first cup. All in all, I'd recommend this hotel and would strongly consider staying again. EXCELLENT LOCATION! SJSF, Thank you for choosing The Warwick for your most recent 6 night stay in NYC! We are centrally located in the heart of the city and we are glad you were able to take advantage of it.

      "content": "Great old-style NYC hotel that has the perfect Christmas vibe. Beautifully lit and decorated, it makes you feel like you step back in time. Until you enter the lobby. NYC during the Christmas season is very busy and obviously crowded, but for such an elegant external appearance, the lobby/reception area was very crowded and a bit disorganized. That being said, our room was very large, especially for an NYC hotel. We had a view of 6th Avenue. Very comfortable bed, sitting area and large closet area. We were in NYC for only a night, yet had a very pleasant experience and would recommend this hotel to anyone who wants easy access to midtown and other NYC attractions. Thank you very much for having stayed with us during the holiday season last year. It is too bad that you didn't have more time to spend with us, but we hope that your next stay with us will be longer and just as enjoyable. Warm Regards, Billy Kang Guest Relations Manager",

From the moment you enter the establishment it‚Äôs one classy place, extremely clean, very grand feeling, filled with history. Check in was a breeze, rooms/bed comfortable, clean and charming. Loved all the fresh flowers in the lobby in the middle of winter. The restaurant/lounge in hotel (Randolph‚Äôs) was kind enough to serve something off the lunch menu for dinner and it was the best grilled cheese sandwich and tomato soup ever. The staff were kind enough to assist us with making transportation and dinner arrangements-went to the ‚ÄúBar American‚Äù which was a short walk from the Warwick. Overall loved everything about this place, especially since it‚Äôs not your average cookie cutter hotel-it has a lot of character, history and class. Thank you very much for staying with us recently and for acknowledging the historical aspect of our hotel. We were thrilled to hear that you enjoyed everything we have to offer and we hope you decide to stay with us again the next time you visit New York City.

      "content": "This hotel has an excellent location at the corner of 54th and 6th. The staff here has been really excellent - friendly and helpful across the board. Our first room was a \"premier king\" on the 6th floor. While the room itself was fine, it faces the back of the hotel which is surrounded by other taller buildings. It was a beautiful day outside and we could not see the sun at all from our room. The front desk told me that this is the case with all of the premier king rooms. Even if we moved up to the 23rd floor, there would still be no sun. It was pretty claustrophobic. We ended up paying to upgrade to a room on the other side of the hotel which made a huge difference. Room is spacious, clean and attractively decorated. I really like this hotel and would return for sure on future visits. Thank you for staying with us recently and for your honest review online. We were happy to read that you enjoyed your room after upgrading to one of our exterior rooms. We appreciate your nice comments about our staff and we hope to welcome you back again.

We never ate breakfast there. Staff was ok, not particularly friendly, but you know if you are nice to people it seems to get a nice response back.

We didn't realise just how good a location we had until we arrived. Stones throw from the Empire State building, 20 minute walk to Times Square and Grand Central Station, short subway ride to Central Park, 9-11 Memorial and Statue of Liberty. The hotel itself was perfect for what we wanted. 24hr reception, free WIFI throughout (no password needed), concierge service, breakfast included, roof top bar, ice machine on each floor and daily maid service. Our room had its own private en-suite with bath/shower, toilet, sink, etc. A hairdryer was provided in the bathroom and shower gel, shampoo, hand soap and body lotion were also provided. The room contained a safe (no extra charge for use), iron, ironing board, large bed, flat screen TV, alarm clock with ipod docking station, telephone, filter coffee machine, dressing table, chairs, large chest of drawers and wardrobe. We did not have a view as we had requested a quiet room away from street traffic, so this was by choice. The breakfast that is provided includes toast, bagels, fresh doughnuts, cereal, yoghurt, fruit, breakfast juices and coffee. We did not see any tea in the breakfast area but you could buy teabags from the local shop and just use the hot water if necessary. The drinks at the roof top bar were expensive but was the same price as other bars and restaurants in the area. We went to a bar outside of the hotel and the were charging roughly ¬£7.50p per pint! Beers purchased in the supermarket were also fairly expensive so not much difference. The hotel was a really good find and if we return to New York in the future we would definitely book to stay here again. Dear mickeymacc, I‚Äôm thrilled to hear that you enjoyed your stay so much! We are so lucky to be in such an amazing neighborhood and love being able to share it with our guests. Thank you for taking the time to review your stay. We hope to see you again soon!

When I spoke to concierge the next morning the lady working was a beast! Told me that she could not honour that price as I did not have a confirmation number. I told her what time I called, and who I spoke to. Blamed me for not getting a confirmation number when I was not given one at all. I told her how disappointed I was and she made it clear to me that if I was not happy with that rate there are many other visitors in NYC that would be happy to take it. I will never return.

This last time, though, might have been the deal breaker. The rooms are becoming really worn, the elevator is hopelessly slow, and the quality of the food in the breakfast room keeps skidding. It's just ghastly cheap, for example, of them to serve pre-shelled hard boiled eggs, like the sickly smelling Chinese made bath amenities in wall dispensers. The only reason to do this is to prevent people from taking hard-cooked eggs back to their rooms or making off with little bottles of shampoo and shower gell, and these details tell the whole experience of staying at this hotel. Every last detail has been refined to make it as cheap, cheap, cheap as possible. Again, I get it. New York is a very expensive city, but on the other hand, the deal breaker here for me is that I now know I can find much more comfortable accommodations at similarly reasonable prices through AirBNB or on other websites. I doubt I'd stay here again.",

The bed was comfortable which was one of my concerns. The hotel staff was friendly as well. We went to the upstairs bar although very nice to be outside it was too crowded. The drinks are pricey but it's New York so we weren't surprised. The continental breakfast was cereal, hard boiled eggs, coffee, bagels, etc. It's included in the price so there were not complaints although we didn't eat anything. The air conditioning did not work in our hotel but we were able to open the windows. I did not inform the staff since we were able to open the windows. Since I got the room on a discounted rate I'm assuming that's why our room did not have a view. If you get room 510 ask to be moved. The view is the adjacent building with no natural lighting (we thought it was raining outside since there was no sun) The only issue with the place is that there are only 2 elevators for 17 floors. If you have to be somewhere give yourself extra time (or take the stairs) However, with all my little comments we were happy with our stay.

Estimate time to hotel was 45 min , cost with tip 65$. Our room was immediatelly ready, room was very clean, spacious, super comfortable bed, enough space for clothes.Free wi-fi everywhere. Breakfast was on 2nd floor, they served coffee, milk, skimed milk, OJ, pancake, 4 kind of bread, boiled eggs, fruit yogurt, fresh fruits, glaze for pancake and dounuts, cup cake, butter, cream cheese. no meat .but you will not stayed hungry. Our room on 8th. Position of hotel is in Korea way, perfect, only 5 minutes to Empire state building (ticket for adult 34$), 8 minutes to Madison Squre garden- we go to basketball game- one of a kind show). When you leave hotel just accross the street there is a fabulous store with Japanese cake and bread, sandwiches (Tous Le jours), price from 1,5$, you must try lemon iceing cake-look like slice of bread, very tasty and soft like everything in store. Also if you like korean skin care ther is 2 stores with good prices of products. We did not use metro , we walk 16-20km every day and so you can feel that urban jungle and see so many things from great buildings, restaurant, architecture, people, everything. Americans are very polite and frinedly. If you want to shop- no problem , just 5 minute from hotel there is Macy's, Manhattan shopping mall, victoria secret, Uniqlo, GAP, H&M,CVS pharmacy-good price from water- cosmetic, witamins, everything you need. just name it. Must try street food, hot dog, falafel,,,,very chip 1-3$. In Soho you can find very nice galleries, designer shopps, jewelry. We also visit, MoMa (free entrance friday from 16-20pm , sponsor Uniqlo,entrance 54 street), Brooklyn bridge-really breath taking bridge, Little Italy- great choice of restaurant- everyone is great- take cheese cake, pasta with shrimps. In China town you will feel like you are in China , if you like chinese kitchen you are on the right place. We also go to central park, just go and sit and enjoy. Times squre is really fascinating, for someone maybe kitch, for me future. Great Seans pub in 46, 48 street with great food and perfect Super New York cheese cake. Prices in america is without tax, tax is 8,8%..Flatiron building is 15 minutes from hotel and you also have park, you can also find great korean restaurant Barn Joo, they have happy hour from 4pm-8pm, drinks, and remarkable oyster 6pieces 6$, 6 jumbo shrimp 6$, spicy chicken wings 6 pieces 5$, very fashion restaurant, great staff.

No stuffy. *The bed is very comfortable. *The black out curtains worked a little too well (slept in til 830). *Cleaning staff is sweet and do not disturb when you put the little card out. *The shower had great pressure and temp *Coffee/hot chocolate/cafe mocha/ and filtered water all available up the stairs from the lobby *Complimentary breakfast had plenty and they refilled constantly (cereal, awesome bagels, apples, bananas, pancakes, yogurt, coffee, tea, donuts, toast, hard boiled eggs, cream cheese/jams etc). *Location is super convenient *Roof top bar is beautiful *Zara (not sure of the spelling), the lady seated downstairs is very helpful when planning tours. Cons *The public can use the rooftop bar and do. Zero seating! I believe it should be for guests only. Also this doesn't give a very safe feeling knowing that anyone can waltz into the building when they want. *Every review said the elevators are slow and I thought before I went that it wasn't really a big deal. However I've changed my mind. I killed a lot of time 'elevator commuting' and it was super annoying to wait 10 mins to go down for breakfast and forget something upstairs and wait to go up and wait to go back down. I wouldn't stay there again for that reason alone. I stayed downtown so I could just walk outside and not have to waste time commuting. This wasted a lot more time than i ever expected. *Parking is supposed to be discounted and we had a very difficult time finding it and just chose a different one. That should be a little more clear before check in. Even a picture of the entrance to help or a map of where on the street one can find the entrance. *We requested a room with a view and didn't receive it (we had 710 the smallest). Our view was of a building. I know they can't always accommodate it but it would have been nice if they could have contacted us to tell us it wasn't possible. We would have upgraded our room to get a better view.",

      "content": "I was in NYC for a conference for a week, so the company had booked accommodation at Nyma and I'm glad they did! Located in Koreatown, Nyma is a hop, skip and a jump away from the Empire State Building, Madison Square Garden, Penn Station and some delish Korean food ( & cheap pizza, if you're into that, which my colleagues most definitely were). In other words, perfect location still in the throng of NYC but not overly busy! I stayed in a room on level 16 with two double beds, an ensuite and a telly, and had awesome views across the city. The only downside was that wifi was having trouble that week and wouldn't work in my room - so I needed to sneak out into the hallway to skype home (and by home, I mean my dog). There was a lot of choice each morning for brekky - from fruit to waffles, pancakes, donuts, fruit juice and tea and coffee, bagels and toast with jam, butter, cream cheese etc - and it was all you can eat (not as many options for vegans like myself, but this is totally not a complaint as I'm used to having to cater for my dietary choices). Although the two ladies who often worked at reception weren't the most helpful nor delightful, the young man (I wish I had have gotten his name for you) was a delight and very, very helpful (particularly when we were enquiring about the wifi issue) and provided great customer service. Also, the luggage men were very helpful (and always had a cheeky quip or two as we left and walked back into the hotel) which made for a jovial environment. I can't comment on the price - as I didn't pay - but I was thrilled with my stay (and the rooftop bar). The lifts are notoriously slow but all in all, great experience here. Dear jesscotttt, Wow- thank you for taking the time to write such a thorough and lovely review! I'm thrilled to hear that you enjoyed your stay with us. And isn't that rooftop bar great? We are so lucky to have those views and love being able to share them with our guests. We hope you'll be back to visit again soon! Best, Liz from Apple Core Hotels",

My room was on the 15th floor and on the first day I think I read War and Peace while waiting for the lift and was about to make a start on Anna Karenina. Talking of breakfast, it was included. The breakfast room was rather crowded. There was a spread of cereals, waffles, donuts, some rather tired looking scrambled egg and some fruit. We decided to eat elsewhere.

      "content": "My first visit back to NYC in 20 years. If you're looking for bells and whistles, this is not the place, however if you just want a decent place to sleep and shower then this is the place. The continental breakfast was surprisingly decent. A simple breakfast of a bagel and fruit is all we needed and it filled us up. The juice was horrible from the machine and they don't have half and half for the coffee if that's what you prefer. Parking was convenient, although my husband was turned away and I had to ask the manager to help us, so after a few circles around the block, they finally allowed him to park in the garage. The garage was packed with cars and I felt like they just didn't want to deal with anyone else. but that's not the fault of the hotel. the room was very basic not overly modern but clean. the view could have been better and I almost felt like I was looking out of a window of a jail house it was dirty and old. You spend such little time in the hotel it really doesn't matter, As long as my sheets and bathroom were clean which they were that's all that mattered to me. Housekeeping seemed very nice the front desk was not very welcoming at all and in fact, a bit rude. Perhaps they need to pay them a bit more to smile and make people feel welcome, but it's NYC so I guess it was nice for them. They probably deal with a lot of craziness and rudeness themselves. The rooftop bar was nice, but the prices are outrageous . We paid close to 40.00 for 3 mixed drinks. NYC is expensive everywhere. 10.00 for a beer. I had the unfortunate experience of leaving my wallet and Credit cards in the hotel safe. I realized this after returning home. I called and was greeted with a very uncaring attitude and was told to call back at 930 and speak to housekeeping. This girl offered no assurances, or cared at all. I did ask for a return call from the GM (which I never received) It was just another day to her and another guest calling to bug her, or so it seemed. I spoke to the Manager of Housekeeping who was very nice and I was so lucky that the staff turned our personal belongings in. I explained that you can't be too trusting of anyone these days and that I truly appreciated the honesty of their staff. At first didn't understand why they wouldn't call and then she explained the privacy issues surrounding calling and I understood. So after all was said and done, I can say that the hotel is a good location, clean and simple and decent prices (except the bar) and continental breakfast was ok. I would recommend this hotel and would possibly consider staying again but next time, but I think I will shop around a bit more as far as hotel choices go. If you go to NYC make sure you have plenty of spending money because nothing there is cheap, but it's a fun city and a beautiful city for photo ops if you like that type of stuff.",

Came back in the afternoon to get room, and opened door to room, and it was a mess! Sheets on floor, dirty towels on floor. Turned around, and went back to front desk and was given another room, and front desk person apologized. So no big deal. Was given another room on higher floor which was nice. Room was clean and normal size for NYC. Breakfast in the morning was good, although pancakes and waffles need warmed up, cold in middle. All and all, would stay there again, cause if you are spending all your time in the room, you need to stay home! Roof top bar is cool with a cool view. Would like to go back and experience that when it is warm, went up to get a quick pic. Only big complaint smell of pot in elevator and floor, more comical than a problem. However I am sure that is not what the hotel wants as an image, especially if you are booking families. Dear Jamie- Dickey U, Oh no! So sorry to hear about the mixup with your first room. Our apologies about that one. Additionally, thank you for letting us know about the smell in the elevator. I sincerely appreciate your light heartedness on the issue, however, it's certainly something that will be brought up to management.

Check in was a little slow but that is to be expected with how busy the place was. After a long car ride I just wanted to get to the room and shower. We stayed on the 10th floor. I was pleasantly surprised when we entered the room. It was pretty big for the city! The room was very clean and I was happy that we had a private bathroom lol. I've stayed in places before in NYC that were double the price and everyone on the floor shared one bathroom. So this made me happy. The water pressure was great! Plenty of towels. I liked the soap and shampoo dispensers that Nyma supplies. I have long hair and those little travel bottles don't do it for me, plus it all smelled great. I loved that the Empire State Building was directly across from our room! The bed was super comfy. We checked out the rooftop bar. It was really neat and cozy. The hotel itself is smack in the middle of Korea Town. There are plenty of choices for food. We are pizza people. If you are too I highly suggest New York Pizza Suprema! Omg. Best. Pizza. Ever. They are within walking distance to the hotel and also offer FREE delivery:) The free breakfast at the hotel wasn't too bad.

Check in was quick and easy and first impressions of our room were good. We found it to be a good size, including the bathroom, and very clean. The bed was huge and incredibly comfortable. Great amenities - large TV, coffee making facilities, safe, ironing board/iron, soap in the bathroom. Another plus is the free wifi, which was actually very good, I never had a issue with it being slow. The only negatives I have were that the room was a little dark, even in the middle of the day with the curtains open and there was a funny smell in the corridor. We chose to get breakfast out most days but we did have breakfast at the hotel twice during our stay. Good selection of cereal, bagels, toast, muffins, pancakes, waffles, fruit, yoghurt, boiled egg and beverages. I've probably forgotten things too! You can't go wrong when it's free. We found a table straight away both times despite eating at peak time. The location was fabulous, just a few minutes from a subway station where you can be anywhere in the city in a matter of minutes. Times Square was close by, Macy's was across the road (pretty much) and there were a good selection of shops and restaurants a stones throw away. The staff were all very friendly and helpful. We had seen previous reviews about slow elevators however only found them to be an issue one time. The rest of the time we didn't wait more than a few minutes which we were happy with.

I traveled with my husband, 13 yr old son and 2 yr old daughter. The hotel is in a great location. Centrally located to everything. When we arrived to the hotel it was around 11am and the hotel was able to give me my room already which was nice. We had a small issue with the AC which was fixed right away.The room has a microwave and small fridge which is a plus considering my daughter still drinks milk before bed. The rooftop bar is a cute little place that has some yummy drinks. The chocolate martini was fab. I have two complaints though. The first is the elevator. During breakfast time it is very difficult to get on the elevator. This is something the hotel probably cannot change so just beware you might have to wait at times. My other complaint had to do with the car service I ordered from the hotel. First of all it was an older mini van. I would expect something nicer. When I got to the airport after the driver left, we noticed that there was some type of cream colored grease on a piece of luggage that I had just purchased for this trip. When I called the hotel the next morning to complain they told me that the driver had nothing in his vehicle like that. I explained to the manager that if it wasn't the van it must of been the room my luggage was stored in. In the end they did nothing regarding the damage to my bag. Because of that, I will not stay again. I am going back to NY in a few weeks but will stay across the street at a different hotel. Other than that issue, my stay was good.",

      "content": "Stayed here form 01/11/2016 to 01/17/2016 first time ever in NYC & needless to say I had an awesome time at this hotel but truth be told I was more in the city than in the hotel since time square is only a few blocks away. The hotel is located right in Korea Town which I found extremely interesting due to all the unique places to eat and things that could be found. If you‚Äôre looking for an extremely modern hotel this might not be your choice, hotel is a little out date but for the price can‚Äôt beat it and whose going to stay in the hotel when your walking distance to everything. Pro: - Hotel has good room service, clean towels every day. - Room was a double bed room and had more space than expected. - FREE breakfast is always a good thing not to mention buffet. Props to Michael who was in the breakfast room and always made sure everything was stocked super nice and had everything nice and tidy. - GREAT LOCATION & very affordable, I can‚Äôt stress this enough, I had read other reviews stating that it was very noisy but of course if your right in the city what‚Äôs to expect. - Check in & Check out was very smooth, nice and easy the staff at the front desk were very nice and sweet. Customer service I would rate 100 because staff is ALWAYS willing to assist you. - If it‚Äôs your first time or have any questions about where to go, subway inquires or things to do concierge Zra is you go to girl, this girl was awesome she knew EVERYTHING there is to know what trains to take, what things to see in what cities, what to do, where to eat, etc. This girl helped us so much, I can‚Äôt thank her enough! - Rooftop bar is a must check out, awesome view. - Train station right down the street. Cons: - During breakfast time waiting for the elevator is a pain, it could have been due to the dates which we stayed but it was better to take the stairs. - Elevators are slow. Overall this hotel suited our needs, it was the first time in the city and I can say that this hotel was awesome had a great time, staff where super nice. I would totally stay here again & recommend it hands down. Dear tahiramarie, WOW‚Äîthank you for such a thorough review! Beyond the elevator speed, it sounds like we managed to deliver services that helped make your visit a great one. We hope to see you during your next stay in Manhattan. Next time, try booking directly through our website for the best available rates and even better service! Liz from Apple Core Hotels",

A porter took our luggage to the room which was not the biggest room (family room for 4 with 2 double beds) but I believe this is normal in New York. We had everything we needed though - coffee maker, iron, toiletries. Took a trip to the rooftop bar which afforded a fab view of the Empire State Building. The biggest shock was when we got into bed. They were the most comfortable beds any of us have ever slept in. Absolutely beautiful and gave us a great nights sleep. Breakfast was continental but very plentiful and lots of choice. It was to a good standard too and you could help yourself to as much as you like. The news was on every morning which helped for knowing what the weather would be doing. The staff were very helpful at reception. The coffee lounge on the mezzanine floor was a welcome addition after a day sightseeing. And we were able to leave our bags on our last day and come back and collect later. The location of the hotel was amazing. Very central in the middle of Korea town with plenty of food outlets nearby and a subway station at the end of the road. A great place to sightsee from and not overly expensive. Would recommend it.",

      "content": "Stayed here on business in November 2016. I ended up here for a night at the end of a recent business trip, as I had to extend a day and couldn't stay on at my existing hotel. The main factor was cost, and this hotel matched those expectations. The hotel is in a very central Midtown location in Korea Town (great food all around). Most of the tourist sites are also close enough including Times Square, Empire State Bldg, Madison Square Park, Union Square, and the shopping at Heralds Square. Also close enough to most businesses in the Midtown area. The hotel checkin was smooth and I ended up chatting with the reception staff, a friendly guy from Delhi, for a bit. The room I had was quite large (for NYC) and on a high floor. It was quiet and spacious, about all one can ask for in NYC. The aircon worked well, as did the TV. The bed was a bit hard for my liking...I remember thinking when will the mattress give a bit. The quietness surprised me since the street level in K Town is quite noisy. Cleanliness levels were fine...nothing to remark on either way. Overall decent but all was very basic...but I guess that's their USP...value and decent lodging. I didn't eat breakfast here or avail any other service. As several people have mentioned, the elevators were slow but thankfully I didn't have to use them much. Overall, it's decent enough but a bit too basic for my preference. If it weren't for the work budget, I probably wouldn't stay here. But, it serves the purpose, and that's all that matters.",

We checked in fine and then waited at least 10 minutes (no joke) for the slowest elevator and then it was a mad rush to get on, people were incredible rude, but figured let them all take the elevator and be rude to each other. Our room (1210) was a mixture of cigarette smoke and Febreeze! The room was so run down, god knows what we were walking on with that carpet, heard every door slam and the ice machine! When looking at the floor plan by the elevator, we had the smallest room on the floor there. The TV didn't swing out so not sure how you could watch tv if you wanted. The bathroom was equally disgusting - nothing say we don't trust you like built in soap dispensers. I guess you get what you pay $200+ for a quick overnight stay, but I'm sure I could find something more comparable and modern than this dump. Dear SuferBetty, Thank you for your review. We‚Äôre sorry you were not more pleased with your stay. Some of our rooms are smoking rooms, but we do have many non-smoking rooms available as well. Unfortunately, we cannot control those smoking outside the hotel. The elevators can get a bit held up during busy hours of the day. We apologize for any inconvenience. Our housekeeping staff works very hard to make sure the rooms and bathrooms are cleaned thoroughly. We will continue to work with them to ensure we are maintaining the highest standards of cleanliness. We sincerely apologize for any inconveniences you faced during your stay.

We came here for a week on the 9th December 2017 for my birthday and honestly could not fault this hotel! The door staff are very friendly, the concierge were very helpful when we checked out they ensured they booked us a taxi to the airport from our hotel so it was 1 less thing to worry about. We had to pay $100 deposit when we arrived which we weren't made aware of so that was a bit inconvenient but we got it back at the end of the week so it paid towards our taxi. The hotel is in a brilliant location! Central to everything!! The rooftop bar has great views of the empire state building especially at night! The rooms were clean and efficient and we're cleaned very well each day! The only thing I would change is the air con / heating system it is so loud! Even when turned off it some how manages to turn itself on and make a noise / blew out cold air which wasn't ideal in December, however, the trip was so tiring we slept through it every night!

The elevator is the slowest elevator I have experienced in a while. Lucky for us we were on the 3rd floor and were able to take the stairs. If you do take the stairs; they are slightly steeper than what you may be used to. The price was very good and that was all we cared about for that particular weekend. If we were going to stay over in NY again, we would probably stay here again. Staff was alright at the front desk but we checked in at a bad time.

Unfortunately I made the mistake of reading updated reviews of the nyma during the few days leading to our trip and got quite nervous that i may have made a mistake in booking this hotel, even though I am a firm believer of NOT believing everything I read as there is no pleasing some people (but there was so many negative reviews)! I need not have worried! We made an excellent choice in this hotel and have come home with great memories of New York unspoiled by a bad hotel. The hotel was extremely clean at all times even during the very busy breakfast period, our rooms were too and more than adequate to meet our needs - had a safe, tea/coffee making facilities, flat screen TV, iron,hairdryer, shampoo, soaps etc.... Of course cleaned every day with fresh towels (some rooms had fridges too). Yes, I agree with the reviews about the slowness of the lifts but that was at the very busy breakfast period when housekeeping needed to use the lift as well as the customers (obviously no service lift!). But then, when on holiday, what's the rush? As for the breakfast? I'm still trying to figure out what the problem was? there was plenty of choice - fruit, yogurts, cream cheese, pancakes and/or waffles, boiled eggs, plenty of bread for toasting - brown and white, bagels, jams, syrups donuts of many varieties, tea/coffee, juice, etc... and everything topped up every few minutes leaving nothing to run out of! and STILL very clean during the breakfast 'rush hour'. Yes, the breakfast areas are very small, but it's a buffet and you want to get out and explore, everyone came in, ate and left! no waiting around for tables - and STILL the place was very clean and not a single member of staff appearing to be harried or rushed and all very nice, polite, courteous and friendly. We found that all the staff were very helpful. Nothing was a problem to them. WiFi signal excellent too. We did not use the gym nor the rooftop bar, so cannot comment on those. The ESB is literally around the corner, with Madison Square Gardens, Penn Station, Macy's and Herald Square within a block or 2. The only criticism I have is the fact that the signage is not lit up outside. It would be nice to be able to see the hotel from a distance (end of the block). We will definitely come back to Nyma and have already started to recommend this hotel to people for 2017! Keep up the great work! Dear Sharonf2007, Thank you for your kind review.

The housecleaning staff must also use the same elevators. Be prepared to spend time staring at the elevator display sign. The breakfast room has one table for every 11 hotel rooms packed into about 400 square feet of space that also contains the food in the typical buffet style. It is not a leisurely experience. The available food items are meant to end the stomach growling, nothing more. The person on duty does his job but he does not add to the dining experience as he is dressed like he slept on the street the previous night. The internet and the television work sporadically. Overall, the hotel needs redecorating. The furniture is chipped, some doors don‚Äôt open properly and the wallpaper is coming off the walls. For New York, however, it is relatively inexpensive, the rooms are reasonably clean and quiet, the beds are comfortable and the housecleaning staff do their job well. Dear Durward2013, Thank you for staying with us. We‚Äôre sorry you were not more pleased with your stay. The elevators can get a bit held up during busy hours of the day. We apologize for any inconvenience. We are continually working on improving our free breakfast to better satisfy our guests. The majority of our guests are very happy with their stay. We offer an excellent value in a great location. Most hotels in Manhattan do not offer free breakfast, wifi, and domestic phone calls. We hope you reconsider us for any future visits.

      "content": "This is was my 4th stay at this hotel. I've stayed here in the past because it was clean and near places I was visiting, but I had never had any concerns in the past, so it was upon this 4th stay I've learned the most important thing you can know about how a hotel truly function is to see how they respond in emergency situations, because no matter what, these arise. At 11:30 pm on Saturday October 8th, 2016, someone starting banging and kicking on my hotel door on the 5th floor. I braced myself against the door while my roommate called security. They said someone would be right up. Five minutes later, the man (I could see through the peep hole by this time) was still banging on my door, kicking it, and then turning around and running and ramming into my door and another right across the hall from me with his body. By this time I could tell he was drunk or high, but even as myself and the other guest in the room across from mine kept screaming \"wrong door,\" he kept trying to ram the door down and would say in response, \"How can it be the wrong door?\" I continued to hold the door, and my roommate called down AGAIN and was told someone was STILL on their way and should be there soon. We begged them to hurry. After more than TEN minutes of continuously kicking and banging on my door and the one right across the hall, the man threw up, and then stumbled off. We called down again and told the front desk the man had left, but he threw up. They said thank you, they would watch for him (they could see him on the security cameras in the hall) and would send up house keeping to cleanup the throw up. Thirty minutes later he was back. screaming, but not kicking this time. We called again. He did leave this time and I didn't know what had happened. 15 minutes later, he was back screaming in the hall. We called again. I heard security this time talking to him. We were called at 1:30 and told they had taken him out of the hotel and he would not be back. The next morning I asked to speak with manager of the hotel because we had another night to stay in the hotel and I wanted to know what they were doing in regards to instances like this to ensure that security was able to respond to a call in less than ten minutes when someone was trying to break down a door! Had he had more malicious intent, or been successful who knows how this will end. I was told there was no manager in that day and they wouldn't be in until the next day. I asked again when I checked out the next day and was told the manager would not be in until after I had checked out. I spoke with the guest with the room across from mine the Sunday and they had made similar calls repeatedly as he banged our doors for that 10-15 minute period. with no one coming up. I emailed the manager and explained the situation after I returned hom. He replied and told me that the person trying to break down doors was a guest in the hotel, and he had been all over the hotel on multiple floors and they had trouble catching him. I emailed back and told him that he was in front of my door and didn't move from my view for over ten minutes and had they responded to my initial call in 10 minutes he woudln't have had a chance to roam the hotel. I never received a response to this. Guest or not, hotels need to have something in place to respond to situations that are as potentially dangerous as this. No, you can't stop the occasional guest who does inappropriate things, but you can have a plan in place that ensures the safety of your guest when things do arise. I will no longer stay here because my security is more important that any of the benefits of this hotel. I don't feel security if the hotel is unable to respond in over ten minutes when myself and another guest repeatedly called for over ten minutes tell the front desk someone was trying to kick down my door. Dear c9ann, Thank you for your review. We sincerely apologize for not being able to handle the security issue quicker. This is not something that happens in the hotel often either with guests or non-guests. We did do our best to catch the guest. We will continue to work hard on our security efforts if something like this were to happen again. We hope that you will give us another chance for your next trip to New York City.

Breakfast was horrible with absolutely no seating sufficient enough to accommodate even a third of the guests. There was nothing but carb loaded items and pre-peeled boiled eggs for breakfast if you could even get to the counter. After fighting my way to the counter I was extremely annoyed that there was not even creamer available for the horrible coffee. I was so disgusted I just left everything. The hallway always smelled of smoke and not the kind of smoke from cigarettes. The worst part of the whole stay though is hoe they processed the accounting. They had pre-authorized and held the cost of the room plus incidentals however after checkout instead of just releasing the difference from the hold amount and the cost they proceeded to charge the FULL amount of the room. This caused serious problems by tying up almost $1000 for one lousy night and forced us to shorten our stay. I have stayed at several hotels in Manhattan all for around the same price range but they all had much higher standards. As a note to management your patrons don't care if you offer free WiFi and breakfast if they are otherwise treated terribly and have a horrible experience. Breakfast means nothing if you don't eat it! The lifts are also the slowest I have ever experienced! Word to the wise spend a bit more and stay with a reputable chain without shady accounting practices that puts the blame one their guests instead of taking accountability ( I personally have several years in customer service including hotel management and have never experienced this).

      "content": "My husband and I just spent another 3 nights at nyma last month, a decision based on our previous stay two years earlier. Prices all over Manhattan have really jumped up since our last trip but even at the current AAA rate, it was still a relative bargain compared to any other place we were considering. And once again, we were really only in the room to sleep. Unfortunately I forgot to request a room away from the street but we were away from the elevator. As a result, on the up side we had a pretty good view of the Empire State Building from our window -- which probably would have been more exciting had we not previously lived in Manhattan -- and on the down side we heard lots of banging and thumping in the wee hours when there must have been materials being delivered or moved for the adjacent construction site. Aah, New York! Always under construction! However, we had one day planned for downtown and the other for uptown which once again made this midtown location ideal for us. Both Penn and Grand Central stations are an easy walk, the Fifth Avenue bus is practically outside the door. Other than the construction noise (which is a gamble at any hotel in any large city and beyond the hotel's control although you would think there'd be a noise ordinance governing construction sites) which only disturbed me our final night, the room was clean and well lit, the bathroom a bit small but adequate, the water pressure good and the complimentary toiletries still in wall mounted dispensers. But the all important rubber mat was waiting in the shower, the bed was comfy, the a/c efficient and fairly quiet so, really, what more do you need when you are going to be out seeing the sights every waking minute?

As we were going to get married we thought the roof top bar would provide some great photos and the free breakfast clinched it for us. When we arrived and first walked into the room the smell was vomit inducing. The maid had just been in and we concluded the smell was something that had been sprayed. It smelled like a public bathroom. It was so bad we put the do not disturb on the door for our entire stay so it didn't happen again. On the first night we had just gotten into bed around 1am and 20 minutes later we were woken up by a young man banging on our door and trying to get into our room. After I shouted at him he disappeared but came back later, banging on all the doors and disrupting the entire floor. I called reception and their response was, 'yeah a few people have called about him'. That was it. The breakfast is decent but there are not enough seats, you can take the food to your room but everyone else will have the same idea and the elevator is so slow there will be 10 people waiting infront of you. The doormen were very nice, other staff not so much. Location can't be beat though. If you are the kind of person that takes photos of every crack in a tile and chip off the wallpaper avoid. If you are looking for a similar price but a decent stay go to one of The Pod hotels. Dear Phunky_Phish, Thank you for staying with us.

Basic, but not horrible. The location was from walking distance from all the biggest attraction in NYC. We picked the hotel for the price and location and in that sense it was the best we could find.

      "content": "We stayed here in mid September as a first tour of NYC for my wife and my third time in the city. We planned our itinerary (as anyone who is only in NYC for 3-4 days should always do if you want to see as much as possible) and chose NYMA on the strength of both its location in Manhattan and the reviews we'd read on here. As my title states, the hotel is EXCELLENTLY located. As it was my third time here, and nearly ten years since the last visit, I felt confident enough to navigate the public transport network system in order to get from JFK to Manhattan. Penn Station is ridiculously easy to get to from JFK either via the Long Island Rail Road or the subway. From Penn Station you're looking at less than 7 minutes in almost a straight line to get to NYMA. At this point I would strongly suggest that anyone reading this with a smartphone downloads an App called \"citymaps2go\" by a developer called Ulmon. This app was absolutely superb for use offline (data charges with EE in the states are astronomical) and the search facility for anything you could want to look for also works offline once you've downloaded the map of the city you want. So, the hotel - well we were put into a room on the very top floor, which was great as it was situated about 4 steps from the rooftop terrace bar. The downside of this is that when visitors to that bar leave it (it closes at 2300 in the week and 0100 thur fri sat I think) they have zero regard for the fact that they're still on a floor with rooms, and tend to make a lot of noise whilst waiting for the only lift. The main reason I didn't need to complain to the hotel (or to the inconsiderate individuals making the noise) was because we were generally so exhausted by our busy schedule that we slept like logs! The aircon is a must in most hotels and the mini heatwave that NYC was experiencing when we were there meant that we had ours on through the night. Whilst we didn't need to use the hotel services or staff for anything, my experience with them was that they were helpful and friendly. The free safe in the room was a nice touch given that most places charge for such amenities. Breakfast - in a nutshell, don't bother. It's likely that whoever you book with, it will be offered as \"free\". There's a reason for that. It's rubbish. You wouldn't pay for it if you were served it and the fact you're serving yourself in a room that seats about 25 people means it's just a gimmick. If everyone resident in the hotel actually used the breakfast facilities each morning it'd exceed NYC fire regs by about 10:1. Something tells me the hotel knows this! We popped in to sample it despite having already planned to eat out each morning. Delis and diners are easy to find within the local area and if you find a good one the food is amazing. Overall, we would definitely stay at NYMA again, the location and comfort exceeds any negatives we could have picked at - just make sure you find a good breakfast! Dear Playa_de_Blues, Thank you for your review. We‚Äôre sorry you were not pleased with our free breakfast. We offer this to all of our guests and it is open from 6:30am-10am, so not all guests are grabbing breakfast at the same time.

We told the hotel we were bitterly disappointed so they put us on the 14th floor in a slightly lighter room of the same size. At around 3:30pm each night we were woken by an ancient ice machine that dropped ice regularly of its own accord. Breakfast: it was included so we had hope. What greeted us in the windowless and crammed room was the tip box and several rubbish bins filled with paper plates and plastic utensils. The coffee, from an urn, was weak and disgusting. There were the cheapest tea bags and 2 low fat mills. To eat: bagels, donuts, cold pancakes, bread, boiled eggs, apples or bananas..That's it! I've been to more welcoming youth hostel on previous travels through Europe, before having a family. When we asked for a price reduction the manager practically laughed in our faces. There are dozens of other decent hotels in the very same NY block! My family moved down the road to the Radisson and were immediately greeted by smiling door men and bellboys.

Dear Augusto P, Thank you for your review. We‚Äôre sorry you were not more pleased with the free breakfast. We are continually working on improving it. We do have an extra room adjacent to the main breakfast room with a few more chairs and tables for our guests. We hope you choose us again for any future lodging needs when visiting New York City.

The room was neat but could use an updating. I could not wait to get out of there because of the smell. Dear Tiffany D, Thank you for your review. We apologize for any inconvenience caused by the lack of water in your room. Unfortunately, these events are out of our control.

Old, dark, drab, depressing. Industrial soap in commercial dispenser falling off wall, the type one encounters in public restrooms of stores. Dirt marks on everything. Closet doors warped and unable to close. TV on opposite area of room to bed, not enabling watching from bed.. Desk also facing away from TV. Horrible odours in room and throughout hallways. Lobby and hallways depressing and ugly, narrow, old, dark. WORST hotel I ever stayed in and I stayed in many, all over the world. Musty odours and dirt-caked on everything. Linens and towels were of Dollar Store calibre. I did not want to touch anything anywhere in the room or bathroom. Would not use the moldy tub on a bet! Breakfast was very poor quality in every respect. I WOULD EXPECT TO FIND BETTER AND CLEANER IN A $50 HOSTEL OR FREE SHELTER. Absolutely nothing in the way of redeeming features!!! And for all this I paid $229 CDN. I've stayed in lovely, clean hotels for a fraction of this cost. Dear Joyce O, Thank you for your review.

All of the staff at the hotel were great. Orlando the doorman was especially welcoming and helpful. He explained the amenities the hotel had to offer as well as helped us find restaurants nearby. I will definitely be staying here in the near future and will recommend this hotel to my family and friends! Dear dave2470, Great to hear that we made your family feel welcome and comfortable. We‚Äôre happy you loved the overall feel of our hotel and had a great experience at LOCL. Thanks for acknowledging Orlando! We‚Äôre lucky to have him as part of our staff.

On Mother's Day, we walked into the restaurant for our included breakfast 5 minutes after 11 am, and the restaurant manager refused to accept our vouchers because, unbeknownst to us, after 11 it is brunch~not breakfast. The front desk again handled the situation beautifully and took care of the situation. The accommodations are clean and comfortable. Housekeeping staff is gracious. Bar has lovely special events. We will be back! Dear Judy S, Great to hear that our team was able to get everything sorted out, and that you got the guest room experience you were looking for.

I also had a complimentary upgrade that was not honored (of course, that's not guaranteed and I knew that beforehand, but the staff member who checked me in didn't mention that until I spent a good 5 minutes searching for the pass and proving I had one). In the end, she did manage to upgrade the bed size in our room, so that was something. But the overall customer service experience was lacking. The room was a nice size with above average space for NYC and modern d√©cor. I can take there being no bathtubs (I knew that going in as I called beforehand), but I do wish they had - and expected - a hot shower with good water pressure.

      "user": "Simon F",
      "content": "We experienced a terrible (Saturday) night at NYLO NYC as the room next to ours was in party mode - the occupants noisy and inconsiderate throughout the night. And when we complained (after midnight) the hotel staff were entirely unhelpful - security came three times and just shared a laugh with the occupants of the room about the people (us) who had complained. After all, it was Saturday night, what did we expect? The front desk even lied to us, saying a manager was a) on the premises [not true] and b) was dealing with the matter [also not true]. The NYLO staff seemed to think it was okay to have a party because the occupants had paid for their room. In the end, we had to insist on being moved to another room (by now it was 3am) so we could get at least a partial night's sleep. We felt abused, mistreated and unsafe. I would warn against having a room with a balcony, as we did, as the party was both in and outside the room on the adjoining balcony. In all my years of travelling and staying in hotels I've never been treated as badly as I did at NYLO NYC. Avoid. Dear Simon F, We‚Äôre so sorry to hear about your experience. The comfort and security of all of our guests matters to us above all else, and the way you were treated is completely unacceptable. We know what an important part of any trip a great night‚Äôs sleep is and we deeply regret that we didn‚Äôt resolve this issue more promptly. We should have relocated you after you first made us aware of what was going on. We will be reviewing what happened in detail with our staff and will be reaching out to you privately to try to make this right. My deepest apologies for this mistreatment. Warm regards, Connie",

The room did have a balcony with a view, which was great, but it was small and no frills, with blackened grout in the shower and a single robe hanging in the closet, when the booking was clearly for two people. But I figured, oh well, we're here to see the city, not the room, and didn't say anything. However, early in the morning after our first night, we were awakened by a very loud noise that sounded like there was a helicopter landing nearby. The walls were shaking and the windows were rattling - there was definitely no more sleeping. I called down to the front desk, and they said they would send someone up. No one came. So we got dressed and headed downstairs to find some breakfast. On our way out, we asked again. They said they would send someone up, so we went out to get something to eat. When we came back, that's when things got a whole lot better. Turns out it was a broken fan, and not only did they switch us to a new room, they upgraded us pretty significantly - to a suite! It was huge, with a sitting area, balcony, and windows on three sides. And no broken fan noise or mold in the shower. We were so pleased! So the rest of our stay was amazing. Thank you so much for making it a great experience! Other things we loved: The location - we like staying in real neighbourhoods (hate anything near Times Square), and this definitely fit the bill. Absolutely loved the Upper West Side. RedFarm - awesome food, right in the same building. We had lunch there twice. Zabars just up the street. Three blocks from the park. Insanely comfortable bed, with bedding that was the perfect weight and texture. Great pillows, too (I'm picky). We received two complimentary sparkling wines, which we enjoyed in their beautiful lobby bar. Close to two subways stops, so getting around was easy. Warm, responsive service - everyone was friendly and nice. Dear ttoronto, We‚Äôre sorry to hear your stay got off to a rocky start. Thanks for letting us know you didn‚Äôt feel like you got a great sense of your room before you arrived. We definitely should have attended to the issues you mentioned when you first made us aware of them.

      "content": "I appreciate the lobby bar, game room, friendliness and location but ask for a hotel to do better at the basics than the NYLO does. I am in a superior king that looks out on the inner walls of the building, with clattering A/C, a weak shower that's very hard to set on a stable temperature, and spartan furnishing. In addition to the bed, for example, there is a desk chair, a table (=desk) and some lockers arranged to look like a dresser. Maybe that's all hip, but as a hotel room it just doesn't work very well. For the money the A/C should not interfere with sleep, there should be a place to sit that is comfortable (and not the bed), and it should be possible to shower comfortably. Oh, and the plastic cups are tacky, the Keurig an environmentally unsustainable way to make pricy and poor coffee. The staff is very friendly and location is great...but there are other, better choices for the money in this part of NYC. Internet is not free because they charge a daily amenities fee.... Dear ejhArlington, We're happy you've found our staff helpful and have enjoyed our location. We're sorry to hear about the issues you had during your most recent stay and regret that our furnishings weren't to your taste. We know what an important part of any stay a great's night sleep is and are sorry about your noisy air conditioner. We've pulled up your room number and we'll be sure to have a technician check on it. We'll also be looking at the shower pressure. We try our best to be environmentally conscious and appreciate your suggestions about our coffee options. We're sorry that your last stay didn't meet your expectations and hope that next time you're in New York you'll consider giving us another try. Know that our staff is always more than happy to help with any concerns and that I can personally be reached through my email cwang@nylo-nyc.com. Warm regards, Connie",

      "content": "The hotel room was clean with nice bed and good amenities and bigger than many other NYC rooms these days. I loved the bar and the overall vibe of the place. But I dinged it a star for two reasons: 1) valet parking took way more than an hour, when they asked for 45 minutes; 2) I was e-mailed a coupon to upgrade my room and then they acted like I was nuts when I checked in, saying nothing was available. Either grant the upgrade immediately in the reservation (rather than give a coupon), or stop making false offers. Neither of those things would deter me from recommending so long as you don't have a car. And don't take the bait to promote them on social media for a false promise of room upgrade. Dear smmphd, Great to hear you thought our rooms were pretty spacious and enjoyed LOCL. We‚Äôre sorry to hear about the issues you had with valet parking. I want to personally apologize for the misunderstanding with the room upgrade. This is definitely not the experience we strive to provide guests so I would appreciate the opportunity to get to the bottom of this. If you're willing, please email me (cwang@nylo-nyc.com) the details of your reservation so that I can look into this further and make this right.

I had never been in one of their Jr. Suites and, although it was an internal room (421) it was really large and comfortable- 2 beds, a large bathroom and a comfortable sitting area with sofa and chairs as well as a desk.

I have to admit, this is the ideal hotel for either type of travel. The hotel is conveniently located and close to everything - both for business appointments and to all the fun attractions. We visited the Statue of Liberty, Ground Zero, Central Park and of course Times Square. All less than 15 minutes away. The rooms are very clean and comfortable and well equipped with outlets and USB chargers. Complimentary WiFi works excellent! The breakfast is super convenient as well, but the absolute best part of our stay is the service. All of the team members went above and beyond and made our stay special during every interaction we had with them. I will most definitely stay at Lex Hotel during my next trip to the \"Big Apple\"!

My positives: +great location +good value +free breakfast items to start the day +helpful and polite staff +wine and cheese reception on Tuesdays +clean +modern +free drinks (tea, coffee, hot choc, water) +good size room despite being the cosy room What could improve: -our cooling/heating unit was noisy so we had to turn it off during the night. Not as much of a problem as the temperature was quite moderate in April. -noisy neighbours woke us up at 5 am! I called reception to complain and they stopped. Not 100% the hotel's fault but as we found out these people had just checked in after a night out. -shower not great as it is a fixed unit so a bit of a challenge to use. I have the impression though that this is typical to NY hotels. Hello Marialena P, It is a delight to know that you had a great stay with us.

The room was modern and exceeded my expectations in terms of comfort and cleanliness. The modern decor and comfortable bed made me feel like a got a real bargain. Our room was on the 6th floor above Lexington, but the city noise didn't bother us at all. We slept like babies after long days filled with lots of sight-seeing. We often try a choose hotels located away from the larger tourist areas to get a real sense of an individual neighborhood. The Lex fit the bill. Lexington Ave has plenty of small restaurants and 3rd Ave provides a wide variety of small eateries as well. The Hummus Kitchen and Penelope's which are both only 5 minutes away, and the food in little India is fantastic.

Staff are welcoming, pleasant and extremely courteous - I found Rumel and Maurice to be particular nice as they always offered me my favourite black tea on arriving back at the hotel after a chilly day out and about! Having complimentary tea and coffee to be brought to your room is a nice touch. The breakfast was better than I expected - although there isn't huge variety (hot drinks, juice, croissants, mini sweet pastries, two types of muffin, apples, oranges and bananas) what is there is delicious, good quality and plentiful. It set me up for the day and I enjoyed watching the world go by from the comfort of the lobby each morning whilst planning my day. I had a cosy room, and it surpassed my expectations in terms of size, cleanliness and design. Lovely toiletries, spotless, great bath and shower, large extremely comfy bed and a bathroom light that makes sound effects! :-). The reason I have given 4 and not 5 is because firstly the air conditioning is VERY loud and woke me up multiple times most nights, and secondly because on arriving at the Lex I was given room 302, which I had the misfortune to spend one night in. It has an adjoining door (locked, not that it made any difference!) with the next room and I could hear every single word the loud couple said. I asked straight away if I could be moved, and the staff were very understanding but said they were fully booked that night. However I could be moved the next day. So I packed up everything (I had just unpacked!), had a sleepless night listening to the couple make a lot of noise and the next day my bags were moved to a quiet haven known as room 701. Much better! So although this was handled well, as I was a solo traveller staying for a week, it annoyed me that they thought they could put me in an extremely noisy room and get away with it. So beware room 302 - I'm not sure how many other (if any) of the rooms have this issue but don't expect the noise will get better - it won't! All in all though after this bad start my room and stay were faultless, and I would definitely stay again.

We had one of the rooms on the ground floor behind the lift, despite this we heard virtually no noise from the reception area or the neighbouring rooms. The room was very clean and quite spacious (for NYC rooms) the bed very comfortable and the bathroom was a reasonable size with plenty of hot water and a good shower over the bath. The location of the hotel was well situated on Lexington Avenue, we walked a lot including at night and the area felt very safe. The reception staff were really helpful and gave us several recommendations for local restaurants. The hotel provided a continental type breakfast with coffee, hot water and orange juice, a really good start to the day especially when we were awake about 4am on our first day in NYC, it would have been a long wait for breakfast in any of the local diners at that time of day. On our last day there was a problem with our taxi booking, the reception staff tried their best to resolve this with the taxi firm and then ordered us another taxi when our failed to materialise.

Every person was friendly and went out of their way to help with anything. When I arrived, the front desk clerk helped me find a room that was quiet and not bathed in light early in the morning. She let me look at several rooms and did it all with a smile. The room itself was pretty basic, without even so much as a chest of drawers to put your clothes. The desk was a narrow strip of plastic, barely sufficient to hold even a laptop. I know that they were trying to save money on furniture but for even a little bit more money on furnishing the rooms, they would feel much more comfortable. The bed was comfortable. People who don't like loud heater/air conditioners: beware! As other reviewers have noted, the fan on the heater/air conditioner is extremely loud and (at least in my room) couldn't be turned to \"low\". There's not a lot in the immediate neighborhood (other than Indian restaurants on Lex) but it's a short walk to subway stations and other good things a few blocks west.

We looked into many hotel, before deciding on the Lex, but what a wonderful choice it was. Being a small boutique style turned out to be perfect. The staff knew us by name and were aware of our circumstances. They were so very kind to us, inquired about our daughter and said they would work with us in anyway to make our stay as stress free as possible. The front desk staff were top notch. I don't want to name names because I would not want to forget anyone. One really super person was Angelika, one of the managers. Angelika recommended a Junior suite since our daughter would be with us the evening before surgery. We had a nice quiet room in the back of the hotel. The beds were super comfortable, the bathroom was large and more than adequate. They provided the usual necessities; shampoo, conditioner, lotions, body wash etc. but they were a better quality than I expected. The one thing I was concerned about when booking a hotel in NYC was that it was clean. I never had to worry at the Lex. Everything was spotlessly clean! Each morning they provided a lovely continental breakfast consisting of juice, fruit, pastries, muffins and croissants. Again, much more than I expected. Coffee, tea and ice were. Not only did you get your coffee but it was delivered a gentleman, with a wonderful smile. He could not do enough for you. Another unexpected treat was their weekly gathering. Wine and cheeses were served in the lobby for two hours. After a particularly rough day spent in an ICU room, we made it back just as the reception was coming to a close. It was no nice to have a glass of wine and enjoy some cheese.hour win time and they made certain we could have a bit. They were so wonderful!! I highly recommend the Lex NYC to anyone visiting NYC. It is so much more personal than the larger hotel. The staff cannot do enough for you. They are so pleased to be of help and never make you feel as though you are a bother. For us, it was the best choice. I cannot think of anything negative to say. I would have liked a small refrigerator and microwave Since our schedule did not allow time for eating out. But with all the pluses we managed very well. I have recommended it to a few friends already and they are surprised to hear about the \"little gem\" we found. In the past I have found Trip Advisor reviews to be most helpful. I wanted to share this with all my Trip Advisor friends and I truly hope this review convinces you to try the Lex when you go to NYC.

I kept expecting there to be some \"catch\" that I wasn't understanding. But after 2 restful, pleasant nights at The Lex, I realized that this is a just a fantastic hotel. Please stop your search now and book The Lex for your next NYC trip. Hi Sean C, Thank you for taking the time to review your stay with us at The Lex NYC. It is wonderful to know that you had a fabulous experience with us. We look forward to your return so that we can provide you with yet another fabulous experience.

      "content": "My wife and I stayed at the Lex Hotel last week for three nights. I highly recommend it. Although it is a budget style hotel, service from reception is excellent and friendly, with good advice on the local area. Angelica and all the other staff were first rate. Room is not big (we had a \"cosy room\"), but was fine for our needs. The bed and bed linen was very comfortable. The bathroom was excellent. We had requested a quiet room, which is what we got at the rear of the building. No traffic noise at all. I'd guess that if your room faces Lexington Avenue, it could be noisy. A basic breakfast is provided at no extra cost (tea, coffee, pastries and fruit). Complimentary coffee and tea can also be brought to your room, which we took advantage of. It's not located in a classy part of Manhattan, but we felt comfortable walking around at night and it's close to the subway and about 10 minutes walk to Union Square. Plenty of restaurants nearby. Highly recommend Penelope's at 159 Lexington Avenue for fresh, reasonably priced meal and Florian at 225 Park Avenue for a more stylish dinner. Two minor issues were that (1) the air conditioning unit was noisy when it came on (for about 5 minutes every 45 minutes, but we got used to it and it didn't wake us up) and (2) it would have been good if the room had a small fridge. We will be heading back to the Lex next time we are in New York. I wanted to personally reach out to you and thank you for sharing your comments on your recent visit with us. It was a true pleasure to have you at our hotel. I'm also happy that we were able see all the great things our neighborhood had to offer. We take a great deal of pride when it comes to servicing our guests and it is great to see that we hit our goal of 100% satisfaction during your stay. Thank you and we hope to see you again very soon. Regards, Omar Sayeed General Manager",

The rooms Both rooms were pretty small, though the clue for that was sort of in the name when we booked them. But bigger and more expensive options are available. The rooms we had, however, were absolutely fine to stay in and nicely decorated, with comfortable beds, flatscreen TVs and separate shower rooms, with free toiletries. The shower was quite big and the water pressure very strong, and the rooms were well maintained and cleaned to a decent standard, too. Staff The hotel staff were all fabulous, with the front desk in particular always polite and keen to help. They were knowledgeable about the direct area and happy to provide advice about getting around the rest of New York, too. Breakfast Breakfast was served in the lobby area and it was croissants and Danish pastries, plus coffee and tea. Some guests stayed in the lobby, while others took cups and plates of food up to their rooms. There was always a plentiful supply of everything. Summary The Lex NYC is exactly as advertised. It‚Äôs a boutique hotel for travellers on a budget. It‚Äôs very good, too, and the area it‚Äôs in provides easy access to most of New York‚Äôs big sights via either nearby subways or on foot if you don‚Äôt mind getting out and about. We give it a deserved four and a half if we could and we‚Äôd certainly book again. Hello Paul B, It is a true delight to read how much you enjoyed your stay with us.

Our room held a queen bed with nightstands on either side, and had a large window. You are in New York; there are traffic noises at all hours. The bathroom was surprisingly large and was stocked with shampoo, conditioner, bath gel, lotion, hair dryer, and soaps. Everything was very clean and tidy. Most impressive was the customer service the staff provided. They are kind, helpful, and made our stay so pleasant. I will happily stay here again and would recommend it to anyone who is looking for a good place to stay in Manhattan at a reasonable price.

So lovely having a bathtub, which although shallow, allowed us to soak our tired legs after walking 12 miles a day! All amenities are provided - toiletries, towels, hairdryer, safe, ironing board, and bottled water. You can also order tea, hot chocolate and coffee to your room at any hour of the day (so good when you are jet lagged!). Breakfast in the morning consisted of muffins, pastries, fruit, tea, coffee and fruit juice. Lovely way to start the day and kept us going 'til lunchtime. The hotel is in a great location on Lex' Avenue - we walked almost everywhere because it was such a great way to experience the city. Although just a short walk away you can catch the subway from 23rd Street. The Newark Express bus stop is also walkable (15 mins Uptown on 41st Park/Lex), so you don't need to bother changing lines on public transport if you're flying in to Newark. Lastly, just wanted to comment on how friendly and welcoming all the staff are. They were all willing to help/explain/recommend things and always accommodating. They rang to check everything in the room was okay, and called the day before we checked out to see if we needed anything. They also spoiled us with a bottle of wine and biscuits on arrival for our anniversary - wonderful touch. All in all, when you're travelling on a budget but want to experience something a little different to a chain hotel - stay here!

The bed was very- very comfortable which is a great plus after a long walking day. The hotel gets you going in the morning, with a simple and limited breakfast: coffee, tea, few pastries and a banana, apple or orange; small but, much appreciated. They offer free Wi Fi - which not many hotels in this big city offer. The hotel is close to subway and bus stops. Our stay at The Lex was a week long and pleasant.

The front desk staff were helpful and gave great suggestions about what to do, where to eat, and how to get there. The location is right in the middle of everything, but in a neighborhood, not in a crowded area. It was easy to get to the subway and to every part of the city. The area around the hotel was an established neighborhood with many places to eat without having to eat at a chain restaurant.

We had plenty of room for walking around each other and all our stuff. The bed was very comfortable with nice linens. The bathroom was large by NYC standards and had good shower pressure. Our room was on the 4th floor on a rear corner. We had little to no street noise. Most nights were very quiet. I do think if you had a noisy person in the room next to you that you could hear them, we did only a few times. Our room had a small balcony. No view but extra space. Coffe and small continental breakfast in the lobby each morning. There is a small bodega next door and larger one just a block away. Plenty of good, reasonably priced restaurants nearby. The staff was very friendly and accommodating. I want to call out Rymel specifically for his customer service. The staff were able to quickly hail cabs, even on a rainy Monday morning. They walked me to the cab holding an umbrella and ensured neither I nor my luggage got wet. I expect that at the Intercontinental but was pleasantly surprised at it here. I will be back. Super clean!

The location of the hotel is in midtown and is within walking distance of lot of the main attractions. It took around 5-10 minutes to walk to Madison Square Park and then a short walk onto 5th into the Flatiron district. If walking is not your thing then you are only a couple of blocks from the subway or cabs are very frequent and easy to flag down outside the hotel. There are also great restaurants close to the hotel if you don't fancy venturing too far on an evening. The staff in the hotel were very helpful and informative. Our bags didn't arrive on our flight and the staff were excellent in directing us to a pharmacy and clothes shops to get some emergency stuff to see us through until they arrived. The various members of staff we met were very friendly and couldn't do enough for you. This is a basic hotel which is reflected in the price but it doesn't pretend to be anything further. If you are expecting waiter service and gold elevators then this is probably not the place for you. but if you want, like we did, just a quiet, clean hotel with somewhere to lay your head after a busy day then this is perfect. The rooms were clean and tidy with a nice bathroom. We didn't have the breakfast in the hotel but it looked good with pastries and coffee available. There was a deli next door which has a load of other food available if you wanted something bigger All in all it was a great trip and the Lex did everything we asked of it to make it that way. We will be booking again on our next trip to NYC. May be sooner than I think if my bet with the guy on reception comes off and Kel Brook wins on Saturday, he promised me a free trip to NYC. Ha ha Thanks for a great trip . Hello, Thank you for choosing The Lex for your first trip to the big city. I am very happy you had a great time at our hotel we are always looking for ways to make your stay even more enjoyable, so keep an eye out for our rooftop lounge area coming in 2017. We look forward to hosting you again during your next trip to New York City. Kind Regards, Omar Sayeed General Manager",

      "content": "Stayed 4 nights in Sept - over the Labor Day weekend. The very good - very pleasant staff: clean, comfortable, modern room: Excellent climate control (wall thermostat); good size bathroom w/ fine (Eden) toiletries & quality linens: good water pressure (hot & cold): most efficient (& unobtrusive) housekeeping: totally free, strong, in-room wi-fi (still sadly a NYC rarity). Our room, at the rear of the hotel, was very quiet, despite being on the 2nd floor. While the location (lower Lexington Ave) is not the greatest scenically in NYC, it is a short walk to Madison Square Park (Shake Shack, Eataly,), Park Ave, Broadway, 5th ave restaurants and shopping, and to mass transit (M23 crosstown bus) and several subway routes along 23rd st. Because I booked through a 3rd party site, I emailed the hotel prior to our stay re room type and was informed ', , ,the room that will be provided will be a standard room, ,with a view of the city.' So much for that, we were given a 2nd floor room, with a sliding glass door, which opened only about 8 inches (due to a 'stop' in the tracking rail), and directly onto pipes coming from the ground and several huge industrial metal tanks (water?) - see attached photo. The Standard Queen is a typical NYC Boutique room (i.e., on the small side - with about a foot and a half clearance from each side of the bed to the wall). The narrow armoire is curiously (& IMHO, inefficiently) designed, with the hanging rod going from the center back of the closet to the front, allowing for only 5 or 6 tightly stacked articles of clothing - a bit inconvenient and insufficient for a couple - not to mention the design results in at least 2/3 wasted/unusable space. Also, coffee & Ice, while available for delivery by calling the front desk, would be more convenient if made accessible to hotel guests at all times in the lobby. Surprisingly, I would still recommend the Lex hotel overall, based upon value for those looking for a most modern, comfortable, and affordable NYC option.",

      "content": "This place is no frills, but if you are looking for a somewhat affordable room in NYC, it's a good option. My room was on the basement level, which means there were no real windows. But it seems like maybe the basement rooms are larger, so that's the tradeoff. My room was pretty big and the bathroom was enormous. The rooms are very minimal when it comes to decor, but they are clean and have everything you need (hair dryer, iron, high quality toiletries and flat screen TV). The air conditioning works really well, so expect your room to be pretty chilly. The AC unit is also a bit on the loud side, but the noise is a steady fan noise, so it didn't bother me. The staff at this hotel is incredibly friendly and nice. They are very eager to help and did a great job arranging a very affordable ($50, inclusive of tip) town car to take me to La Guardia from the hotel. They also let me hang out in the air conditioned lobby for a long time so I could avoid the sweltering heat while I killed time between checking out and heading to the airport. If you are looking for a place that is clean, has friendly service and is in a good location (very short walk to Madison Square Park, Union Square, Eataly, lots of shopping, etc.), this is a good deal. It's not super cheap, but by NYC standards, it's pretty darn affordable. My room was $282 a night (including taxes) while the other hotels I typically stay at were around $500-$600 per night that same night.",

The size of the room was perfect for our needs. I do have to say the soundproofing could use a bit of improvement for the connecting rooms but apart from that it was great!

      "content": "So we booked this hotel because it offered a suite and a balcony at a very good rate. We even called in advance to make sure that we where getting a balcony and they said yes. When I checked in the hotel on Monday July 11, I was told that the balcony was out of order due to renovations of the outside of the building. What a disappointment! The hotel manager right away offered free breakfast for the entire stay for all three of us and some extra Marriott points Great! The room was great until time to sleep. My son was going to sleep on the sofa bed but it was so uncomfortable you can feel all the springs. He called front desk to ask for a bed topper which they did not have. But was able to get some extra blankets but it was still uncomfortable. They felt bad and discounted the room for that night and offered to change rooms with two queen beds the following morning if we wanted. The next day they changed out the sofa bed with a new one but still the mattress was horrible. I got a call from the manager and explained the problem so he offered a rollaway bed verses changing rooms.. Our room was very nice.. the sofa bed was the problem.. Now its the second night, the roll away bed was just as bad.. We gave up!! On day three we went to K mart and purchased a full size egg cratered topper for the sofa bed and WE FIXED the sofa bed problem. We laughed and still laugh at ourselves carry this egg crate bed topper from K Mart on the subway to our hotel.. The only thing I can say is GET some egg crate toppers for these darn sofa beds so that your guest can sleep comfortable. It was a $20.00 investment for me and your hotel got to keep the topper which probable got thrown away by the cleaning people. Other than the disappointment of the balcony being out of order and having to keep my window shades closed all day because men where on it working and the horrible sofa bed mattress this hotel was very nice and all the staff was so kind. Audrey the lady who was cleaning my room was wonderful! The bar in the lobby was great! breakfast was amazing. Yes I would back and I would love to have the same room when the Balcony in order so that I could enjoy it. Maybe next summer! My bed king size bed was great I am giving the sleep quality a very good rating only based on the sofa bed. I am trying to be fair here.",

The location is ideal close to almost everything and the subway is only a few blocks away The staff is fantastic, always smiling and ready to assist. There's a cool chic vibe in the lobby but the hallways are a bit bare. We were fortunate enough to get upgraded to a balcony room which was a great perk. I wish the breakfast had a bit more to offer but none the less it is complimentary and the pastries were fresh, Great way to start the day. The housekeeping team does a great job as our room was spotless everyday, which is so pleasant to come home too after a long day of sightseeing. That's right I said home because that is how the staff at The Lex makes you feel. Keep doing what you are doing and we will definitely be back. Cheers!

I was bummed that while I was the only one in my group to call in advance to request a higher up, corner room, I was the one who got a room with a weird view of and access to the heating/cooling equipment immediately out of # 207's window. It felt awkward to have sliding glass door access to that kind of mechanical space. And I wasn't sure if maintenance workers would be accessing the space immediately outside my window, so I just kept the blinds closed the entire time-- which defeats the point of this room having a sliding door or even eye level windows. A window higher up on the wall that acted more like a skylight would seem to make more sense both for security and aesthetics. But the rest of the room was well designed, even spacious for a single traveler. The bathroom was a great size particularly! And the complimentary wifi, water, and coffee (upon request) were a great touch. I would highly recommend and would stay here again-- just on a higher floor for sure.",

I provided feedback to the hotel a few days after we left and have had no response so I feel obliged to leave this review. Housekeeping was rubbish. Day one, excellent. Day two, came in to our pyjamas and belongings slung onto the floor. Day three, toiletries removed and not replaced etc etc. It was very shoddy. On the weekend, we wished to stay inside to watch the wimbledon final on TV before venturing out. The most horrific stench of pot smoke invaded the room. After about an hour as it got stronger and stronger, we had to go out. I complained at the desk and was told 'Yeah we know'. Great. So we had to find a bar to watch the final in. Location - ok if you're happy to get around by walking or subway but not much in the immediate vicinity. Although, the restaurants recommended were good. I have stayed at a number of 'boutique' hotels at the same price point in the city over the last 5 years and this doesn't come anywhere close to the others, the Distrikt, for example is MUCH better. Really disappointed the hotel chose to ignore my complaints and thus I have to leave this review. But seriously, don't stay here.",

We were greeted by the most lovely young lady (I do wish I had took her name) with the best smile we had seen all day. Smooth and friendly check in, offered us everything we could have wanted and even gave us tips on where to get the best doughnuts! Our room was lovely. Perfect size for what we wanted, which was dumping the bags and going out in the City! Cleanliness was tip top, couldn't have faulted that at all. I believe our Housekeeper was called Mary, she deserved every penny of the tip we gave her, so thank you. The coffee machine was a lovely touch, enjoyed using that every morning with the smell of coffee filling the room. The wireless charging radio was a god send, I had left my phone charger in the UK and I was so happy to have this in the room. The bathroom was wonderful, brilliant shower and clean towels daily. The location was perfect. Right next to Port Authority and 2 minutes walk into Times Square, and you couldn't hear a thing so you could get a good night's sleep ready for the next day! There are some road/building works going on around the Hotel, but they didn't bother us at all. Workmen were very courteous and kindly moved over if you needed to get past. We had originally booked a shuttle back to JFK after our 4 night stay, but cancelled that and took a pre-booked cab from the Hotel. The hotel booked it all for us and was there on time! Would never use a shuttle again knowing that this service is available. From arrival to departure, we loved every single thing about this hotel. From the comfy beds, the free ice water in reception to the smiling faces of the Staff every morning, noon and night. It was perfect. We will DEFINITELY be back. Thank you again for everything.

We were the only people checking-in at that time yet it took 25 minutes to check in. The woman checking us in said she wasn't sure if our room was ready (even though it was past check-in time?) and she would go check on it herself. Why would she leave us downstairs and go upstairs to peek in our room? It was very weird. She ended up using the walkie talkie to ask a bell man to check on our room which was more efficient but still strange to me. Then she had me do a \"mobile check-in\" on the ipad where I entered all the information I had already provided. Such a waste of time- if you're going to have mobile check in then have kiosks. Don't make guests check in twice. And finally she couldn't print room keys on her own for some reason and had to wait until her front desk colleague wasn't busy and he printed our room keys. When we finally got up to our room we waited for our luggage. Finally someone arrived and he brought us someone else's luggage. So then we had to wait again. As far as the room was, it was nice. The mattress was terrible though. When we finally got to our room, there was a letter on the desk addressed to Ms. Van Hess. No idea who Ms. Van Hess is. I called down to the front desk and they told me they write those for everyone and our rooms got switched at one point. When I opened the letter it was general hotel info including wifi info. For a hotel that promotes water conservation, what a waste of paper this was! The letter was addressed to Ms. Van Hess and that was the only personalized part. But that means they have to reprint a letter for each guest when they could just laminate it and put it in the hotel info notebook like the rest of hotels do. Another advantage to that is if rooms get switched at the last minute then it isn't obvious. Not surprising after the letter but there is not a recycling bin in the room. I had requested a high level room with a nice view. We got a level 4 room with a view of the Port Authority. I only mention this because it added to our sour first impression- I know that simply requesting something doesn't mean the hotel can accommodate us.

Rooms were a little on the small side but for a solo traveller more than adequate. Had all the amenities one would need, extremely comfortable bed, and the working aircon was a huge bonus. Location wise it's about a 4 minute walk to times square. Extremely convenient if exploring that part of the city. However, a great find is 2 doors down from the hotel. A great little coffee shop/cafe where everything on the menu is $2. All fresh and all good quality. Extremely useful. Only a couple of gripes. Having to re-connect to the wifi daily was a slight annoyance and the connection kept cutting in-and-out making it tricky whilst working. But just a small gripe. The only other is that, being a small/narrow hotel, the walls are paper thin. On my floor i could hear the noise from all the other rooms around me. Unfortunate that one of these was a crying baby every morning at 5.30am but this is just bad luck on my part. Additionally, the elevators are VERY slow but, again, just a small gripe.

      "content": "Sorry for the delay in posting this review. This is a vertical splinter of a hotel: 30-some stories high, with only about 5 rooms on each floor. As a result, there is little in the way of amenities on each floor, but the hotel staff work hard to compensate. If I wanted ice, they would deliver it to our room, no charge (a tip would be up to you). And when we asked for an second luggage rack, one was delivered fairly quickly. They were also willing to deliver a small refrigerator if I wanted it, but our room was on the small side, even by Manhattan standards. The modest eating space in the hotel was apparently in flux while we were there. But the hotel offered a decent if not exciting breakfast at a pretty decent price - so if you just want to get and eat some basic food pretty quickly without fuss so that you can get to your sightseeing, it was just fine. We stayed there using a middle-level Priceline offer (not the name your own price option), where we were pretty sure which hotel we would probably get, and would stay there again in a similar situation. As an aside: the hotel seems well-connected with tourists from abroad - not a complaint, just an observation. This actually added a bit of charm to interactions in the elevators. Some other reviewers were a little troubled by its proximity to a parole office and its clients. Because we were there on a holiday weekend, the office was never open. In this part of Manhattan the numbered east-west streets tend to be more grungy than the north-south avenues in general - not sure if the parole office makes any difference. We always felt safe. The hotel is not far from Penn Station, near some useful subway lines and stops, and not far from Ninth Avenue, which has more restaurants and shops that are frequented by locals.",

The room was lovely big enough for me and my sister the only issue was not a lot of hanging space. The room was clean and bedding changed every other day. As It was my Birthday they sent up a lovely big Cupcake and a hand written card. We asked the hotel to book us a Taxi to return to JFK and we got a lovely private car which just finished off my lovely 50th Birthday holiday to NYC. I would go back to this Hotel when I go back to NYC. Thank you for your glowing Distrikt Hotel review! We are thrilled to have helped make your Birthday celebration a special one.

Dig the mod design, location is a bit on the edge but still lots within walking distance and much better pricing then many other hotels. Loved having a mid-town view to Times Square from the 28th floor king room. The room was nice but fairly basic, only place to site besides the bed was a desk chair. We arrived early, the friendly reception folks valeted the car and stored our bags while we saw a Broadway show then we checked in after dinner. overall very good experience. We are elated to hear that you had such a wonderful stay with us. We agree that our location is very convenient for traveling to and from, but parking in the city can be a challenge at times.

The beds are very comfortable and the room we had was nice and quite, we were on an upper floor which had a view out to the water and city west Thank you for your kind words and we are pleased to hear you had such a wonderful time with us for a second time! We are delighted to know that our location and accommodations were satisfactory and that you enjoyed your time spent in our Collage Bistro & Bar.

I booked because it was reasonably priced, especially for its location and offered free wifi in the rooms, not just the lobby. The staff were friendly & helpful. The room was a good size, had all the facilities you'd want (fridge, safe, tea/coffee making facilities etc.) and the free wifi was always working. Location wise, it was ideal for me, as theatre was my primary reason for visiting NYC, so staying on west 40th St was perfect. It was also close to metro stops too and despite being opposite the bus terminal was not noisy at all (I was on 19 floor). Travelling on my own, I also felt at ease in the vicinity of the hotel at night and also felt comfortable to be in the hotel's bar on my own in the evening. I definitely recommend this hotel and will almost certainly stay there again! Thanks for the super positive review! We are happy to hear that your stay in May was exceptional. So great that our staff, accommodations, value, and location was everything you were hoping for during your New York City trip. We are certainly delighted to hear that your stay was pleasant enough to feel like a \"home away from home\".

Surely a big mistake that TripAdvisor should have corrected ?? Anyway my stay at my favourite hotel in Manhattan was again another wonderful experience. This is my 10th stay here and I would not contemplate staying anywhere else, I love it. Right in the middle of Midtown, walking distance all over the city (if you like to walk), subway if you don't. Theatres and restaurants on your doorstep. Port Authority on the next block, so handy to get to/from airports, to/from outlets, and you don't need to hunt for a taxi when you come back laden with your purchases !! The beds are so comfy, I always feel as if I have had a great sleep, no noise whatsoever (we were on the 30th floor). Everything in the room you need, great showers, lovely toiletries, tea/coffee, clock, and if there is something you need just phone the receptionist and they are there !Our housekeeper Mary kept our room spotless. WIFI is free and you just have to sign in after 24hrs and it is there. Lifts were no bother when we there, but most hotels lifts are busy in the morning with people checking out, so you expect that, who is in a hurry in the Big Apple anyway ?? Bar/caf√© downstairs is great for a pre theatre cocktail or a nightcap before bed, very relaxing. The staff are amazing !!! Thank you for an amazing stay Nesha, Sahara, Netanya, Kit, Sharis, Hadi,Mary, Dennis and Manny ! TILL THE NEXT TIME ! L.Forrest Thank you for another review to make us smile! We all look forward to each time you stay with us and it's always such a great pleasure to welcome back one of our best guest. We are delighted to say that this was your 10th visit to Distrikt and it won't be your last. We will certainly pass your kind words to our staff, I'm sure they will be touched to hear all of the wonderful things you have said about them.

We received a warm welcome (and cold fruit water) at reception after a long day of travelling, and were helped with TV reception, bag storage and booking a car to the airport by staff who were all friendly, polite and efficient. The cosy little bar to the back of the ground floor was also a real bonus - with happy hours. Our room was on floor 6 with no view - but to be fair New York is all about getting out there, so we didn't really mind. The room was modern and clean with an empty fridge for use, coffee machine and hairdryer with a great bathroom with large shower. (bathroom products good - note - no shower gel) We found TV reception and wifi to be a bit inconsistent - you just have to keep logging in again. As others have mentioned, the street is experiencing quite a bit of construction, but you can easily access the subway, or get onto a better street for walking. Plenty of cafes, deli's and convenience stores within short walk for essentials. Excellent location for theatre visits. Would be happy to stay again. Thanks for the super positive review!

Hotel staff was very friendly at check in. They personally checked to see if my room was ready because I had arrived an hour before check in. We are thrilled to hear that we were able to meet all of your expectations during your stay. It's good knowing that our location was ideal, our accommodations were satisfactory, and our staff went above and beyond for you. Please don't hesitate to make Distrikt your home away from home the next time you visit New York City!",

On the southern edge of Midtown and Hell's Kitchen, it was the perfect spot for us. Madison Square Garden, Central Park, Times Square - we could walk to all. Lots of great restaurants and classic Irish pub's all around too. Close to the theatre district, MOMA, Rockefeller Center and so much more. Arrived early and they held our bags while we set off to explore. Came back to find our check-in all ready, including the bags. The place smells great too - lemongrass and lavender soaps and lotions I'm guessing. We're so happy to hear our modern charms wowed you during your recent stay with us at Distrikt!

Nicely appointed rooms at a somewhat reasonable NYC price. Liked that it was a boutique hotel not a big chain. After a very early flight, we were fortunate they could accommodate an early check in. I mentioned it was my husband's birthday and on the 2nd night they had a special cupcake and handwritten note of birthday wishes delivered from the staff. That was above and beyond service! Thank you for your kind words and we are pleased to hear you had such a wonderful time with us. We like to think we are a great home base for all of our guests to begin their adventures here in NYC, as we are close to many wonderful attractions and sights.

      "content": "This is the third time I have stayed here and I am noticing a decline. Used to receive a nice welcome treat. No more. The desk staff used to be attentive and friendly, with a bellman who greeted you by name. Maybe he retired. The room was the worst of the three different rooms I've had. The hair dryer didn't dry and made sparking noises the one time I tried it. The shower pressure was so hard it was painful. We joked about having to steel ourselves before showering. It was probably the setting on the shower head that neither of us could reach. The bed was fine but I hated the hard pillows. The tv has terrible reception. We couldn't watch CBS or NBC. The good news is that the hotel is centrally located and is a good value. It is just off 9th Ave, which is lively and jam packed with restaurants. The building is not old and therefore not creepy. It is mere yards from a subway stop that includes the A train with an easy connection to JFK. Also, they have a lovely seasonal cocktail in the bar and charming bartenders. I'd recommend the place on value and location, but I miss the little things. If you select this place don't let them place you in a low floor, front facing room. Value, yes, but sadly I may need to find a new 'go to' place in NYC. Thank you for your feedback. Though we are happy to hear you had a pleasant time in our Collage Bar, we are very sorry to hear that we did not live up to your expectations this time around. We at the Distrikt pride ourselves in providing excellent customer service and we apologize for not meeting the high standards that not only you expected, but that we also expect from ourselves. We agree that the location is ideal however, we are very regretful that we were unable to provide you with this personal experience during your last visit. If you decide to give us one more shot in the future, bringing up any issues during your stay will allow us to rectify some of them. Again, while we wish you had a more pleasant time during your stay with us, we certainly thank you for taking the time to provide honest feedback on your experience. If you decide to give us another chance on your next trip to NYC please contact us directly next time so we can make your next stay as enjoyable as possible!

The bathroom had no fan, thus creating the temperature in the room to increase. The rooms are all located by the elevator. The hotel location is not the greatest, for the value of the small room. I was expecting much more for my dollar. Thank you for taking your time to write your review. Though we are excited to here that our staff were all so wonderful, we are sorry to hear we were not able to exceed your expectations. We do hope you brought these issues up during your stay as we would of been able to rectify some of the issues you experienced. Furthermore, all of the bathrooms in the hotel have vents. The vents in the bathrooms are continually pulling air through a system on the roof. Although they don‚Äôt make noise or have switches, they are working. Since we are a boutique hotel, there are only five rooms per level leaving some rooms closer to the elevator however, not all of them. Regarding our immediate scene, most of our guest find it convenient and exhilarating since we are across from the Port Authority and in between the bustling streets of Times Square and Hell's Kitchen however, we are sorry it was unsatisfying for you. Again, we do appreciate you taking the time to provide us with your feedback and hope to be able to welcome you again for your future visit to New York City.",
